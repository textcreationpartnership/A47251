         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOur HIGHNESS can never rule ſo equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Empire of
Learning, but that the Poets will pretend to a particular<pb facs="tcp:99270:3"/>Intereſt
in Your Protection, as well as in Your Fame: And the <hi>Grecian</hi>
Maſters, who are the firſt of the Tribe, will reckon themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd,
unleſs they have the Honour of paying their Duties before the reſt.</p>
            <p>In the Late Degeneracy of Ancient Valour, they have had the Hard
Fortune to paſs for meer Romancers; becauſe their Worthies and their
Adventures appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our preſent Notions of Human Conduct and Force: But
from Your HIGHNESSE's Actions, they expect a full recovery of Faith and of
Eſteem: They<pb facs="tcp:99270:3"/>are impatient for the Time, when they may renew their
old Title to Prophecy; and when the Fame of Your HIGHNESSE's Atchievements
ſhall juſtifie the Miracles of their Verſe. For Princes SIR, have this
Advantage above us the Vulgar Herd of Scholars; that <hi>we</hi> read the Story
of Heroick Exploits, barely to underſtand and to admire them; <hi>THEY</hi>
to imitate, and to exceed them.</p>
            <p>And whilſt thus, with a haſty kind of Loyalty, the Good Old
Songſters are coming to wait on Your HIGHNESS, 'tis no wonder if they make
uſe of any poor<pb facs="tcp:99270:4"/>Guide to Conduct them: never fearing that with
Your HIGHNESS's Juſtice, the Worth of the Addreſſers can ſuffer by the
meanneſs of the Introducer;</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Pleaſures and the Diſtaſts which we receive from former
Years and Men, are chiefly owing to our ſelves: Their favours affect us not,
unleſs we apply them; and their Injuries have no force; but what they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
from our Folly. The <hi>Good</hi> People of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity never benefit us, 'till
we work our ſelves with pains into their Acquaintance: and the <hi>Bad</hi>
never corrupt us, but when we court their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. 'Tis on this account that,
while we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Old Examples of Ignorance or Vice, the Patterns of Wit
and Virtue engage our Curioſity as well as our Eſteem. And among theſe,
we entertain a particular Affection for the celebrated A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THORS of Ancient
Times: We are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of underſtanding their Actions and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes as
well as their Writings, and are the more eager to enquire into <hi>Their</hi>
private Story, the more agreeably they divert us with the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of other
Men.</p>
            <p>Yet Envy and Ingratitude have done their beſt to deprive us of
this Satisfaction. Many of<pb facs="tcp:99270:5"/>the Great Maſters ſurvive only in the
Front of their Labours; and we read their whole Hiſtory in a Line of the
Title-page. Fame, with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Spirit of Informers, diſcovers
Ill-Nature in her very Praiſe; and under the pretence of giving a
<hi>Loud</hi> Sound to their Memory, excuſes Herſelf from giving a
<hi>Diſtinct</hi> one. Now the POETS have a deeper ſhare in this
Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune than the Profeſſors of other Arts and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Philoſophers
commonly leave numerous Sects behind them, which endeavour to inlarge their own
Credit by ſwelling the Legends of their Founders. Orators, being allow'd a
Hand in the Buſineſs of State, paſs down in the Current of Common
Hiſtory: And the Hiſtorians themſelves, while they Illuſtrate the Times
they live in, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſt their private Affairs with the Memorials of Publick
Actions: and, borrowing the Vanity of an Art to which they lend Materials,
never fail to draw their own Picture in their Nobleſt Work. But the Poet by
the Rules of his Order, forſwears Buſineſs as heartily as Riches: He is
to cover himſelf from the World with Shades and Privacy; and even the noiſe
of his own Praiſes muſt not be ſo great as to break the Cloud which
inveils his Perſon. If he chance to Addreſs his Verſes to the Honour of
the preſent Age, then perhaps Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity may know the City, and the Times
he liv'd in: But his chief Affairs lie amongſt the the Old Race of Mortals;
He is to revive He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes that have died in their very Braſs: And tho' he may
poſſibly reſcue <hi>Them</hi> from the Gulph<pb facs="tcp:99270:5"/>of Time, he is
<hi>Himſelf</hi> commonly ſwallow'd in the Attempt.</p>
            <p>If the M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SES have been civilly treated in any Chronicle, it
muſt be in that of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Affairs. As they are reported to have
been born in that Countrey, ſo they may with more juſtice be ſaid to have
given Birth to it. The Language, the Arts, the Civility, the Laws, the
Religion, and the very Triumphs of <hi>Greece,</hi> all ſprung from their
Fountain, and were all nouriſh'd by their Streams. Nor indeed was their
Service ill repaid, while the good Effects of it continued. In the
flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing height of Wiſdom and of Empire, the Poets were rank'd
amongſt the Guardians of the State; and a Victory at one of their Contentions
in the Theatre obtain'd as fair a place in the Publick Regiſters, as the
Actions of a ſucceſsful Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. But when by a muiual failure, Greatneſs
began to languiſh for want of the incitement of Wit, and Wit to ſink
becauſe unſupported by Greatneſs: the Poetick Tribe, like a decay'd
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, not only ſuffer'd in their own Credits, but were unable to ſecure
the Honours and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievments of their Predeceſſors. The Old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes in
the Art of Verſe had their Trophies ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd about in the wide Field of
Hiſtory; but their weak Poſterity could not gather them into a Pile, and
ſo they have roll'd down in the ſame Confuſion to our Times.</p>
            <p>To pick up ſome parts of theſe divided Honours, and to lay the
Sacred Fragments together, is the Deſign of this ſmall Attempt. The
Cementing,<pb facs="tcp:99270:6"/>the Poliſhing, the giving the nice touches of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry
and Life, ſhould be the Care of Noble Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts.</p>
            <p>It was thought convenient, not to ſtop at thoſe admir'd
Maſters whoſe Labours ſurvive as well as their Memory; but to take in the
moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated of the other Train, who live on the Stock of their Ancient
Glory; and have made <hi>That</hi> their paſs-port thro' ſo many Ages,
ſince their trueſt Credentials have been loſt upon the Way.</p>
            <p>Some Endeavours after their proper Characters have been added in
both Diviſions: Becauſe their Wit makes the beſt part of their Story; and
becauſe to give the Life of an Author without ſpeaking of his Works, is no
wiſer Conduct, than to write the Memoires of a Prince or Hero, and to omit
the Relation of his Exploits.</p>

Profeſſion have made their Advantage of the uncertain Diſpute; have been
willing their Great Maſter ſhould be acknowledg'd of Divine Original, as
well as their Art: And advis'd the contending Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to reſign the Prize to
Heaven. Without doubt the Honour of Poeſy is much advanc'd by the Noble
Controverſie about its Author. And while we own <hi>Homer</hi> to be Him,

               <p>If we take the pains to examine all the Ancient and Modern

of it, between One and Two hundred Years before the Building of <hi>Rome.</hi>
But then if we enquire farther into the Particulars; the Proſpect grows
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Darker: and he has ſcarce more Fables in his Poetry, than Authors

                  </note> liv'd but Four hundred Years after him, is
ſaid to have drawn up the entire Story of <hi>Homer.</hi> And we have ſtill
among his Works a Piece, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes us the ſame favour by its Title;
tho' Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men have not yet agreed to acknowledge it for Genuine. However,
it cannot fail of a civil recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while it is not manifeſtly convicted as
a Cheat. And, ſuppoſing the worſt, why may not we as well entertain our
ſelves with the feign'd Hiſtory of a Perſon we admire, as with the
fancied Statue or Picture, when the true are irrecoverably loſt? In thoſe
Arts, if one ſingle Mark or Feature be but<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99270:8"/>known, there is
ground enough to proceed on in forming the whole Piece. And here, after all the
ſtrange Reports, we have ſtill Certainty enough for a Foundation.
Therefore, while we ſtick to the common Notion form'd of him by all the
World, of a Blind, Indigent Bard, ſtrowling up and down, and owing all his
poor ſubſiſtence to his Muſe: ſhould the larger Memorials not appear
ſtrictly true; yet they muſt needs ſeem in ſome meaſure pleaſant
and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, when they are built on ſo good a Bottom.</p>
               <p>If then we may be allow'd to tell the Tale after
<hi>Herodotus;</hi> His Mother <hi>Critheis</hi> was born and liv'd at
<hi>Cuma</hi> in <hi>Aeolia:</hi> where, happening to be with Child by a
ſtol'n Embrace; her Guardian after her Parents Death, to avoid the Publick
Scandal, ſent her away to a Friend of his at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> which City had
been lately founded by a Colony from <hi>Cuma.</hi> Within a little time after
her remove, going with the Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Women to a Feaſt, celebrated
near the River <hi>Meles,</hi> ſhe was ſuddenly brought to Bed of
<hi>HOMER;</hi> and gave the Boy the Name of <hi>Meleſigenes,</hi> from the
Place of his Birth.</p>
               <p>Upon this Accident, ſhe was oblig'd to leave the Gentleman, to
whoſe Care ſhe had been committed by her Guardian; and to ſet up in
<hi>Smyrna</hi> for herſelf; getting her Livelihood by her Work. This thriv'd
ſo well with her, that ſhe did not only procure a Competent Maintenance,
but could afford to bring up her Son in the Arts and Improvements proper to his
Age. Her Induſtry and Prudence gain'd Her ſo fair a Character in the City;
that in a little time ſhe receiv'd the Addreſſes of one <hi>Phemius,</hi>
an eminent Teacher of Letters and Muſick; and after a long Siege, at laſt
conſented to Marry him. The Old Gentleman admir'd the extraordinary Parts of
his Son in Law; and taking all the Care in the World of his Education, found
him quickly ſo far before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99270:9"/>with the reſt of the
Scholars, as to be able to cope with his Maſter in his own Art. And in
ſhort, at his Death, left him all his Effects, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the
School.</p>
               <p>Our Poet, falling to his Hereditary Profeſſion, ſoon
advanc'd it to ſuch a prodigious degree, as to make himſelf the common
Wonder, not only of his Countrymen; but of all the Strangers that reſorted to
<hi>Smyrna;</hi> on account of the Great Corn-Trade, for which that City was
famous. Among other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners who applied themſelves to him for the
Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Converſation; one <hi>Mentes,</hi> the Maſter of a
Veſſel, and a Man, as Times went, of tolerable Knowledge and Learning, was
ſo taken with his Company; that by a great many fair Promiſes, he prevail'd
with him to leave his School, and to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board for <hi>Leucadia,</hi> the
Merchant's own Country. The Main reaſon of His Compliance ſeems to have
been the extraordinary deſire he had of informing himſelf in the Manners
and Cuſtoms of different Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which he judged would be of great uſe to
the deſign he had before form'd, of making Poetry the Buſineſs of his
Life.</p>
               <p>He had now furniſh'd himſelf with abundance of Remarks on
the Places occurring in his Travels. When, by reaſon of his ordinary
Infirmity, a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Humour in his Eyes; not being able to make the whole
Voyage, He agreed to be left at <hi>Ithaca:</hi> being recommended to the care
of one <hi>Mentor,</hi> an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of the Merchants, and a Man of the
greateſt Character for Juſtice and Hoſpitality, in that Iſland. And
here it was that he pick'd up the main part of his Stories about
<hi>Ulyſſes.</hi> His Old Friend the Merchant, returning ſome time after,
and finding his Eyes a little better, took him aboard again: and carrying him
about to many places, at laſt landed him at <hi>Colophon:</hi> where his
Indiſpoſition returned ſo violently as to take away his ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99270:9"/>He had reaſon to be tired of rambling now,
and accordingly, as well as he could, repair'd home to <hi>Smyrna.</hi> But it
ſeems he had loſt all his Intereſt there, by leaving the City after ſo
unaccountable a manner. So that finding himſelf in a fair way to be
ſtarv'd, he reſolv'd to take a Journey to <hi>Cuma,</hi> where his
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had liv'd; and to ſupport himſelf as well as he could upon the
Road, by his Begging and by his Muſe. But finding his Poetry take very much
in a little Town on the Way; He ſetled there for ſome time, and got his
Victuals by Haranguing the People in Verſe. However, ſupplies did not come
in ſo faſt, but that he quickly grew as Hungry as ever: and ſo took his
leave of his Patrons, and went in earneſt for <hi>Cuma.</hi> Here,
ſurprizing the People with his Songs and his Art, he was encourag'd to
addreſs the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for a maintenance: engaging upon that Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
to make their City the moſt Famous in the World.</p>
               <p>The greater part of the Magiſtrates were at firſt inclin'd
to accept his Propoſal: only one of the Grave Gentlemen declaim'd bitterly
againſt admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; and told his Wiſe Brethren among other things, that
if they made a Cuſtom of taking all the
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Blind</hi> Strowlers,
into their Protection, the Town would be fill'd in a little time with a
compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of uſeleſs Creatures, fit for nothing in the Earth but to breed a
Famine.</p>
               <p>And to this Accident <hi>Homer,</hi> ow'd his Name. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much
Debate, this Opinion carried the Day, and was proclaim'd by the Crier;
decreeing no ſupport to be given to the Petitioner. Surpriz'd at the ſad
diſappointment, he left <hi>Cuma</hi> for <hi>Phocaea:</hi> only wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Inhabitants at his Departure, that there might never riſe a Poet in their
Country, to celebrate ſo ungrateful a People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99270:10"/>Arriving at <hi>Phocaea,</hi> He plied his
old Trade of Poeſy; and made a ſhift by reading and ſhowing his Verſes,
to keep Body and Soul together. There happen'd then to live in the City, one
<hi>Theſtorides</hi> a Raskally ſort of a Pedant, whoſe Talent reach'd no
farther, than to teach Children their Letters. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had ſence enough
to admire the Excellency of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Art; and thought he ſhould make
a fair Prize, if he could trick him out of his Wit. With this Deſign, he made
his Applications after a very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil manner; and promis'd the Poet to allow him
a convenient ſubſiſtence, upon condition he might have the liberty of
tranſcribing thoſe Pieces, which he had already by him, and whatever he
ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe farther. <hi>Homer</hi> was glad of any ſecurity from
Hunger and Cold; and ſo, without ſuſpecting any Knavery, agreed to live
with the Fellow; and to give him what liberty he pleas'd in relation to his
Writings. Under the Care of ſuch a Patron, he is ſaid to have wrote the
<hi>Leſſer Iliad,</hi>

                  <hi>Theſtorides</hi> having receiv'd this Poem, and a great
many other Pieces, that his Gueſt put into his Hands, thought it was time for
him now to be gone, and to make the beſt Market of them he could.
Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, ſtealing away from <hi>Phocaea,</hi> he went for
<hi>Chios;</hi> and there opening a School, and publiſhing <hi>Homer</hi>'s
Verſes in his own Name, they thriv'd ſo much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99270:10"/>with
him than they had done with their Author, that he quickly found himſelf
poſſeſſed of a ſufficient ſtock of Money, and a larger of
Reputation. Poor <hi>Homer</hi> all this while was living hard on his Wit at
<hi>Phocaea;</hi> and ſeem'd more concern'd to provide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
neceſſary ſuſtenance, than to venture an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain queſt after the
Thief. But, a little while after, there happen'd ſome Perſons of Learning
to arrive there from <hi>Chios;</hi> who, wondering to hear ſeveral pieces of
Poetry recited by <hi>Homer,</hi> that they had been oblig'd with from another
hand in their own City; took occaſion to give an account of the new
Schoolmaſter, and what a Trade he drove with his Verſes. <hi>Homer,</hi>
underſtanding where his Sharper was fix'd, reſolv'd to take the trouble of
unkenneling him; and went preſently to the Sea-ſide to meet with a
Veſſel for his Expedition. As ill luck would have it, there were no Ships
directly bound for <hi>Chios:</hi> however finding a Fleet ready to Sail to
<hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thraea</hi> with Wood, he thought it would not be much out of his way,
if he embark'd with them for that City. Approaching the Mariners, he ſaid a
great many fine things to them, and eaſily prevail'd to gain admiſſion
into one of the Veſſels. As ſoon as ever he was well ſeated, he began
to ſhow his Gratitude and his Art; and made his Prayer for their good Voyage
in ſuch Strains as theſe.

drive them to <hi>Erythaea.</hi> But here things did not go altogether ſo
well as <hi>Homer</hi> could wiſh. For getting a Friend to enquire at the
Harbour, he heard of no Ships that were ready to make a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age toward
<hi>Chios.</hi> However to try his Fortune, a little farther, he deſir'd to
be led along by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſomething lower, to the Place, where the
Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen us'd to ply with their Boats. Some of theſe appear'd to be Bound
for <hi>Chios,</hi> but were ſo Churliſh as to deny a poor blind Follow the
ſmall favour of a Paſſage. <hi>Homer</hi> netled at their rudeneſs,
broke out into his ordinary Revenge of Verſe.

on the Shore: when preſently after he heard the ſame Seamen bawling near
the Land; they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been driven back by a Tempeſt to the Place, where they
ſet out. He did not fail to make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this Accident, but told
them gravely, that the only Cauſe of their Misfortune was their baſe
refuſal of his Requeſt; and engag'd they ſhould have a good Voyage, on
condition they'd be more civil, and honeſtly take him in. The Fiſhermen,
upon ſecond thoughts, eaſily imagin'd ſomething more than ordinary in the
caſe; and conſented to hoiſt him into the Boat. But as ſoon as they had
croſs'd the Sea, they went about their Affairs, and left the Poor
Paſſenger on the Beach to ſhift for himſelf. It ſeems he ſtraggled
luckily enough toward <hi>Chios;</hi> but met with an Adventure in the way,
which ſtop'd his Journy and his Deſignes. For happening in his Ramble to
follow the Cry of a company of Goats, that were feeding in the Country, he
lighted at laſt on the Goat-herd himſelf: who enquiring into his Condition,
and receiving a moſt lamentable ſtory of Troubles and Afflictions; took
pitty on the Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Stranger, and led him into his Hut. As ſoon as
they had refreſh'd themſelves with a little Food, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> beginning
a pleaſanter Tune, and a Relation of his former Travels; work'd himſelf
into the entire love and eſteem of his honeſt Hoſt, and was oblig'd with
a Lodging there for that Night. The next Morning, the Goat-herd though it his
Duty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Maſter with the good Fortune. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, leaving
<hi>Homer</hi> in the Cottage, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a ſpeedy return, he
repair'd to <hi>Boliſſus,</hi> (a Town hard by) where his Maſter liv'd,
and inform'd<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99270:12"/>him what a Miracle of a Man he had met with;
deſiring his Advice in the Point how he was to be diſpos'd of. The
Gentleman had no great inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to countenance a blind Vagabond; however
he order'd the Stranger to be brought to him, to ſee if he anſwer'd his
Character. The Goat-herd return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Field, led <hi>Homer</hi> into Town,
and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him to his Maſter. And he, after much talk, receiving full
ſatisfaction of the Wiſdom, Ingenuity and Integrity of his Gueſt;
intreated him to take up his Quarters there in the Houſe, and to engage in
the Inſtitution of his Sons. <hi>Homer</hi> accepting the Propoſal with a
thouſand Thanks; immediately fell to his Charge. And here it was that he
Compos'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of his lighter Pieces, with univerſal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
particularly the <hi>Battle of the Froggs and Mice.</hi> The report of his
reſidence in the Neighbouring Parts, ſoon reach'd <hi>Chios:</hi> Upon
which Advice, <hi>Theſtorides</hi> thought fit once more to give him the
ſlip, and was glad to ſneak away with the firſt Fleet, and ſeek his
Fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homer,</hi> however ſatisfied with his new Patron's
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, yet could not entirely forget the main deſign of his Expedition. So
that after a conſiderable ſtay, he beg'd leave to carry on his firſt
Purſuit, and to proceed for <hi>Chios.</hi> Here, tho' the Thief was fled who
had occaſion'd his Journey, yet he found his Labour very well ſpent,
meeting with extraordinary encouragement, and quickly raiſing himſelf a
flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing School; where he inſtructed the Youth in his own Verſes. And
now, being arriv'd at a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs he never before enjoy'd, a plentiful
Fortune; he got him a Wife, and reſolv'd to fix in ſo good Quarters. Under

               <p>This is the miſerable account we have of <hi>Homer:</hi>
theſe are the faint ſhadows Antiquity reflects at ſuch a diſtance. But
if we recal the Mind from the dark view of his Story, and ſix it all at once
on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques that he has left us; our Pity is turn'd into a deeper Wonder:
We forget the rude Draught of his Perſon and Fortune, to contemplate on the
Nobler Image of his Soul. The Blind Songſter immediately vaniſhes; and in
his room we are preſented with the Father and Prince of Verſe the Preacher
of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Vertue, the Founder of Arts and Sciences, the Great Maſter
of Civil Life, and the Counſellor of Kings.</p>
               <p>The Ancients have heaped much higher Titles on him than theſe.
But 'tis eaſie to obſerve, that their Rhapſody of Praiſes is rather
founded on particular Excellencies, than on the entire Beauty of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems,
and the juſtneſs of the whole Deſigns. They admir'd the vaſtneſs of
his Thought, the torrent of his Words, the ſweet Charms of his Fictions, and
the uſefulneſs of his Precepts and Counſels: But they had little regard
to the Maſter-piece of his Divine Art, his Conduct and Inſtitution. It's
true, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> have laid down a number of Rules
drawn from Nature and Reaſon: by applying which, they ſometimes applaud his
Contrivance in General; and ſometimes inſiſt on the diſcovery of
peculiar Graces. But then they either commend the whole, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining the
Parts; or elſe they illuſtrate the Parts without intimating their Relation
to the whole.<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99270:14"/>They either ſhow us the fine Machine at one
view, without taking it to pieces: or elſe they lay thoſe Pieces at too
great a diſtance, and never give them us all in the ſame Light. The moſt
Judicious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Boſſu,</hi> who built his Doctrine of the
Epique Poem on the Foundation they had laid, is the firſt that has drawn
<hi>Homer</hi> at his full length: Attoning, by this eminent piece of Service,
for the many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Labours of his Countrymen in the ſame Field; by
which, in the Judgment of a Great Man, <hi>They ſeem rather to have valued
themſelves, than improv'd any body elſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis from <hi>Boſſu</hi> then, that we muſt thus learn the
Deſign, the Conſtruction and the Uſe of the Iliad and the
<hi>Odyſſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <q> 
                  <p>In all matters which we undertake with delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and
conduct, the end propos'd is the firſt thing in our Minds, and that by which
we govern the whole Deſign, and it's particular parts. Now the End of the
Epique Poem being the Regulation of Manners; 'tis this the Poet muſt have
firſt in his View, before he ſet's to Work.</p> 
                  <p>But then, there's a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
Philoſophical and the Poetical Doctrine of Manners. The Schools content
themſelves with the conſideration of Vertues and Vices in general. The
Inſtructions which they give are calculated for all States, People, and Ages.
The Poet now, has a nearer concern for his own Countrymen, and a particular eye
on the preſent Diſtreſſes and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies that they labour under.
With this deſign he chuſes ſome Moral Point, the juſteſt and the
moſt proper that he can imagin: and to urge the Truth of it, he does not ſo
much employ the force of Reaſoning, as the Arts of Inſinuation and
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; accomodating himſelf to the particular Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and
Inclinations of thoſe, who are either to<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99270:15"/>be the Subject or
the Readers of his Work. Now let us ſee how exactly <hi>Homer</hi> has
anſwer'd theſe Rules.</p> 
                  <p>He found the <hi>Grecians,</hi> for whoſe Inſtruction he
wrote, divided into as many independant States and Principalities, as they had
Towns of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Note: notwithſtanding which, they lay very often
under a neceſſity of uniting in one Body againſt a Common Enemy. Now it
being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to joyn theſe two different Conditions or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
in one Maxim of Morality; or a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Poem: He has built them into two
ſeparate <hi>Fables.</hi> One for <hi>Greece</hi> in general, as join'd in a
Common Body; tho' compos'd of parts otherwiſe not depending on one another.
The other for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular ſtate, as they may be ſuppos'd to have
ſtood, in time of Peace, when they had no Obligation to ſuch an Union or
Alliance.</p> 
                  <p>As to the firſt of theſe; 'tis a known Remarque that in all
Confederacies compos'd of independing States, the Good Succeſs is in a great
Meaſure ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fair Underſtanding maintain'd by the Chief
Commanders. And on the contrary, that ſcarce any Miſcarriage happens, which
was not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the Heats and Jealouſies, and Ambition of the
different Princes; and the uneaſineſs they pretend to feel in obeying any
ſingle General. So that the moſt uſeful Leſſon <hi>Homer</hi> could
give his Countrymen, conſider'd in this Relation; was to ſet before their
Eyes the ſad Calamities which muſt neceſſarily fall both on the People
and the Princes, by the unhappy Ambition, Diſcord and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs of the
latter. He takes therefore for the Foundation of his <hi>Fable</hi> this grand
Truth, That <hi>the Miſunderſtanding between Princes in the ruin of their
States.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99270:15"/>But this Truth, before it can be ſet in
its full Light has need of a ſecond to ſuſtain it. 'Tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in
ſuch a Deſign, not only to repreſent the Confederate States at firſt
quarreling among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo, unfortunate: but to ſhow them
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reconcil'd and victorious. Let's ſee how he has joyn'd theſe
matters in one ſole univerſal Action.</p> 
                  <p>Here are ſeveral Princes, independant one of another, united
againſt their Common Enemy. The Perſon who has been choſe
<hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to offend the moſt Valiant of all the
Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates. The affronted Prince is enrag'd to ſuch a degree, as to
relinquiſh the Union, and to enter into an obſtinate reſolution of
engaging no farther in the Common Cauſe. This Miſ-underſtanding affords
the Enemy ſuch an advantage, that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are in a fair way to quit their
Enterprize with diſgrace. The Prince himſelf who made the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is
not without his ſhare in the Evils which he has brought on his Party. For
having given his deareſt Friend leave to Succour them in an extream
neceſſity: this Friend of his is kill'd by the Grene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Enemies. So
the quarrelling Chiefs being both grown wiſe at their own Expence, the matter
is taken up; and they joyn Forces as before. The happy Conſequence of which
recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement is, that this Valiant Prince who had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, not only brings
the Victory to his ſide; but compleats his private Revenge, by killing with
his own hands the Author of his Friends Death.</p> 
                  <p>See here the firſt Plan of the Poem, and the Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on uniting
in one important and univerſal Action all the particulars on which it is
rais'd.</p> 
                  <p>Now this muſt be made probable, by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of
Time, Place and Perſons. There muſt be Men found out of eminent Character
and Fame<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99270:16"/>either in Hiſtory or otherwiſe, on whom this
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may be handſomly fix'd. <hi>Homer</hi> has choſe the Siege of
<hi>Troy,</hi> and ſuppoſes the Action to have paſſed there. To that
Aery Gentleman of his Brain whom he fancies Valiant and Cholerick, he gives the
Name of <hi>Achilles;</hi> his General of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates he calls
<hi>Agamemnon;</hi> and the Enemies Chief, <hi>Hector;</hi> and ſo of the
reſt.</p> 
                  <p>He has ſtill another task left; the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating himſelf
to the Manners, the Cuſtoms and the Genius of his Auditors, the People of
<hi>Greece;</hi> to engage them to read his Work, and to gain their
Approbation, by the Praiſes he gives them: So that they might forgive him
thoſe Faults which he muſt neceſſarily repreſent in ſome of his
chief Perſonages. He has acquitted himſelf of theſe Devoirs to
admiration, by making the Victorious Princes and People, all <hi>Grecians,</hi>
the Anceſtors of thoſe whom he is concern'd to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p> 
                  <p>But not being content to propoſe only the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Point of
the Moral, which he deſigns to teach, ſo as to fill up the reſt of the
<hi>Fable</hi> with vain Garniture and uſeleſs Incidents: He extends his
Moral by its neceſſary Conſequences. For, in the Queſtion before us, it
is not enough to know, that a good underſtanding ſhould be always
maintain'd among Confederates; but 'tis a piece of Wiſdom of almoſt equal
importance, if any Diviſion happen, to keep it ſecret from the Enemy: that
their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may hinder them from making any uſe of the Advantage. And,
in the ſecond place, while ſuch a Breach is not really made up, but only
diſguiz'd, it is by no means adviſeable to preſs on the Enemy very
vigorouſly; leaſt we diſcover the weakneſs which we are oblig'd to
conceal.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:99270:16"/>Now the Epiſode of <hi>Patroclus</hi>
conveighs theſe two Inſtructions in a moſt admirable manner. For when he
appear'd in the Arms of <hi>Achilles,</hi> the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans,</hi> taking him
really for that Prince reconcil'd and reunited to the <hi>Grecians;</hi>
preſently ran away, and relinquiſh'd the Advantages which they before had
over the Confederates. But <hi>Patroclus</hi> who ought to have been
ſatisfied with this ſucceſs, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailing <hi>Hector</hi> too
cloſely, and forcing him to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Combat: ſoon let him underſtand,
that 'twas not the true <hi>Achilles</hi> which his Armour cover'd; but an Hero
of much inferior proweſs. In ſhort <hi>Hector</hi> kills his Antagoniſt;
and recovers the Advantages his Men had loſt on the feign'd Reconciliation of
<hi>Achilles</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Odyſſey</hi> was not made, like the <hi>Iliad,</hi>
for the inſtruction of all the <hi>Grecian</hi> States join'd in a
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Body; but for the uſe of each State as it ſubſiſted
ſingly. Now a State being compos'd of two parts, the Head that commands, and
the Members that obey; both theſe have need of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; the one to
govern, the others to ſubmit to Government.</p> 
                  <p>There are two Vertues neceſſary for a <hi>Governour,</hi>
Wiſdom to order, and Care to ſee his Orders put in Execution. The Wiſdom
of a Politician is not acquir'd but by long experience of all ſorts of
Affairs, and by an exact knowlege of all the different forms of Regiment in the
World. Then again, the Care of Adminiſtration never permits the Supream
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour to be far from home; but obliges him to a conſtant reſidence:
And thoſe Princes who ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from their States, are in great danger of
loſing them; in regard they give occaſion to the higheſt Diſorder and
Confuſion.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:99270:17"/>Theſe two Points may eaſily be united in
the ſame Perſon. A King leaves his Subjects to viſit many Forreign
Courts; where he informs himſelf of the Manners and Cuſtoms of ſeveral
Nations. Hence there naturally arriſes an infinite number of Incidents,
Dangers, and Adventures very uſeful for advancing the Doctrine of Politicks.
On the other ſide this abſence of the King draws a thouſand
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances on the Kingdom; which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded till his return,
whoſe Preſence only can re-eſtabliſh will have the ſame part, and the
ſame effects in this <hi>Fable,</hi> which the Diviſion of the Princes had
in the other.</p> 
                  <p>The <hi>Subjects</hi> have ſcarce need of any more than one
general Maxim, which is, to ſuffer themſelves to be govern'd, and to obey
faithfully; whatever reaſons they may fancy to themſelves againſt the
Orders they receive. 'Tis eaſie to join this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the other,
by furniſhing this Wiſe and Induſtrious Prince with Subjects, who in his
abſence are more inclin'd to follow their own Judgments than his Commands:
and by ſhowing from the Miſeries which their Diſobedience brings upon
them, the unhappy Conſequences which almoſt neceſſarily attend theſe
Private Counſels when car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in oppoſition to the Supream Power.</p> 
                  <p>But now, as 'twas neceſſary that the Princes of the
<hi>Iliad</hi> ſhould be Cholerick and Contentious; ſo it's as
neceſſary in the <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> that the Chief
Perſon be ſage and Prudent. This rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a mighty difficulty in the
Fiction: becauſe this Chief Perſon ought to be abſent, for the two
Reaſons already given; which are eſſential to the <hi>Fable,</hi> and
compoſe the principal Spring: and yet he can't abſent himſelf, without
tranſgreſſing the other Maxim of equal importance, that a King 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99270:17"/>ought upon no account to ramble from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p> 
                  <p>It's true indeed, there are many neceſſary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which
might be a ſufficient Covert to the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Politician in this
caſe: But then, ſuch a neceſſity is important enough of
<hi>itſelf</hi> to furniſh matter for a Poem: and this Multiplication of
the <hi>Action</hi> would be faulty. The Remedy therefore is, in the firſt
place, to fix this neceſſity and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Hero,
<hi>without</hi> the Bounds of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em. And, Secondly, the Hero, having been
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to abſent himſelf for ſome reaſons antecedent to the
<hi>Action,</hi> and placed <hi>without</hi> the <hi>Fable;</hi> he ought not
embrace this opportunity of inſtructing himſelf; and ſo wilfully keep
from his own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. For, at this rate his Abſence would be plainly
voluntary, and they might juſtly impute to him all the Diſorders that broke
out at Home.</p> 
                  <p>So that in the Conſtitution of the <hi>Fable,</hi> the Poet
ought not to take for his <hi>Action,</hi> and for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Work,
the departure of a Prince from his Country; nor his voluntary ſtay abroad,
but his Return; and that too as it is retarded againſt his Will. This is the
firſt Idea which our Poet gives us. His Hero makes his firſt appearance in
a remote Iſle, ſitting by the Sea ſhore, and ſurveighing the Water with
Tears in his Eyes; as the Obſtacle which had ſo long oppos'd his return,
and kept him from the ſight of his dear Country.</p> 
                  <p>Laſtly, As this forced delay is ſomething more natural and
more likely to happen in Voyages by Sea; <hi>Homer</hi> has judiciouſly
pitch'd on a Prince, who reign'd in an Iſland.</p> 
                  <p>Let us ſee then, how he has fram'd the whole Action; making
his Hero a Man of Years, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for improving himſelf in Wiſdom
and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:99270:18"/>A Prince being oblig'd to quit his Country,
and to lead an Army of his Subjects on a Forreign Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition: having
gloriouſly accompliſh'd this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, is leading back his Victorious
Forces to his own State. But in ſight of all the Arts and Endeavours with
which his Impatience can inſpire him; the Tempeſts keep him on the Way
ſeveral Years; and caſt him on many Countries, differing in Manners and
Government from one another. In the midſt of theſe Dangers which he
encounters, his Companions, refuſing to obey his Orders periſh all by their
own Fault. Mean while the Great Lords in his Territories, abuſe his
abſence, with the vileſt Inſolence, and put all things in Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at
home. They laviſh his Riches; they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour treacherouſly to murder his
Son; they would conſtrain his Lady to accept of one of them for a Husband:
and carry on their violent courſes with ſo much the more liberty, in regard
they perſwade themſelves, that he will never ſee them again. But, in the
End, the Prince returns; and, only making himſelf known to his Son, and to
ſome Perſons, who ſtill continued Loyal, and firm to his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: He
is himſelf the Witneſs of his Enemies Impudence; He gives them their juſt
puniſhment, and reſtores to the Iſle that Peace and Tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which
had ſuffer'd Baniſhment with him.</p> 
                  <p>Here, as the Truth which ſerves for the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this
Fiction, and which with it compoſes the <hi>Fable,</hi> is, that the
abſence of a Perſon from his Concerns, and his Negligence in his own
Affairs, are the Cauſe of great Diſorders at home: ſo the principal and
the moſt eſſential part of the <hi>Action</hi> is the Abſence of the
Hero. This takes up almoſt the entire Poem: for not only his real Abſence
is of many Years continuance: but even after his Return, he do's not let
himſelf be publickly known:<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99270:18"/>And this prudent diſguize,
of which he makes ſo great an advantage, has the ſame effects on the
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Troubles, and on thoſe who know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his coming home;
as if he was ſtill abroad. So that he is abſent with relation to them, till
ſuch time as he diſcovers himſelf in their Puniſhment.</p> 
                  <p>The Poet, having thus compos'd his <hi>Fable,</hi> and join'd
the Fiction to the Truth, has made choice of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> King of the
Iſle <hi>Ithaca</hi> to ſuſtain the chief Character; and has
diſtributed the inferior parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Penelope, Telemachus,
Antinous,</hi> and what other Names he pleaſes.</p> 
                  <p>We need not here inſiſt on that multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Precepts, which are ſo many parts and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſequences of the
Fundamental Truth; and which the Poet has ſo artificially diſguiz'd in
thoſe Fictions, that are the Epiſodes and the Members of the Grand Action.
Such are theſe Moral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. <hi>Not to intrude into the Myſteries of
Government which the Prince would keep ſecret.</hi> This is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to
us by the Winds ſow'd up in a Leathern Bag; which the miſerable Companions
of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> would needs be prying into; and ſo loſt the uſe
and benefit of them. <hi>Not to be captivated by the Charms of an idle and
unactive Life:</hi> ſuch as the Songs of the <hi>Syrens</hi> invited to.
<hi>Not to ſuffer our ſelves to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted with Pleaſures,</hi> like
thoſe Wretches who were chang'd into Beaſts by <hi>Circe.</hi> With an
infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Inſtructions neceſſary for all ſorts of
Perſons.</p> 
                  <p>This Poem is more for the uſe of the People than the
<hi>Iliad;</hi> where the Subjects ſuffer more by the ill Conduct of their
Princes, than by their own Miſcarriages. But in the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> the
loſs of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects can by no means be charg'd on the Hero: On the
contrary, this Wiſe Prince leaves no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried to make them happy
partakers of his Return.<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99270:19"/>Thus the Poet tells us in the
<hi>Iliad,</hi> that, he <hi>Sings the Anger of</hi> Achilles <hi>the Cauſe
of ſo many Grecian's Deaths.</hi> In the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> on the other

               <p>But ſure if Theories in Philoſophy, are ſo much in
faſhion, Theories in Poeſy might hope to be as kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiv'd. 'Tis now a
days the Character of Fools to admire what they don't throughly know: But the
Men who pretend to Thought and Sence, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eſteem a thing 'till they
fancy they underſtand it. Thus they are not raviſh'd with the fair variety
of<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99270:19"/>Nature, till they have framed ſome kind of Clue to the
Mazes of her Works; and a reaſon for every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, every little Feature
in her Face. They would not admire the Celeſtial Motions, unleſs they
carried their Spheres about with them in their Heads; and could meaſure the
ſteps of every rowling Orb. And certainly, they cannot be better pleas'd with
a Poet, till they form ſome Notion of his Conduct and Deſign. They cannot
value his Magick, unleſs they conceive how 'tis wrought: nor acknowledge the
Power of any Charms, that pretend to conquer, without being underſtood.</p>
               <p>Thus, were this Doctrine no more than a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hypotheſis,
it would be of real uſe to the World; becauſe it would recommend the Poems
to Mens eſteem; and by that means, inforce the Leſſons they convey. But
we may as rationally imagin that all the Letters which expreſs the
<hi>Iliad</hi> and the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> were jumbled into their preſent
Order by a chance throw: as that the Poems were compos'd by the Author without
ſome General and uſeful Proſpect. And, when we are to judge what this
Proſpect was; we muſt be guided by the Natural drifts and turns of the main
Actions, and by the Manners of the People for whom he wrot. And then, we
ſhall be carried into the ſame Plan which <hi>Boſſu</hi> has
finiſh'd, and of which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> drew the
firſt Lines.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd, that the ſame Excellent Father, and
other late Maſters have rais'd on this Model, ſeveral new ſtructures,
which probably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entred into <hi>Homer</hi>'s Brain. Thus particularly,
that the Divinities whom he employs, are ſometimes Virtues and Vices,
ſometimes Natural Appearances, and only ſometimes the Supream Powers of
Heaven, is a Diſtinction which if <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had
ever heard of, 'tis not likely that one of them ſhould have 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99270:20"/>baniſh'd the Poet his Common-wealth for ſpeaking
injuriouſly of the Gods; or the other have made him do Pennance in Hell for
the ſame Crime.</p>
               <p>They are indeed as much in an extreme, who make <hi>Homer</hi>
infallible, as thoſe who deſpiſe him for a trifling Dotard. He could not
paint his Deities without Spots and Blemiſhes: And muſt we allow him a
Prerogative which he thought fit to deny Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Or when all the reſt of the
World, Immortals and Mortals are faſt aſleep, muſt he only with his

the ſame in all Ages, muſt needs have Manners and Humours and even

curious Palates, are the Fables which we find in <hi>Homer,</hi> the odd
Manners of his Heroes, and the Improprieties (as they call them) of his Stile.
And in all theſe Charges, they ſhow themſelves ſo very <hi>Modern,</hi>

the People in Virtue, ſeem rather to countenance the vileſt
Diſorders.</p>
               <p>To the firſt of theſe Objections it may be return'd, that
while the greater part of the Fictions diſcloſe ſome glorious and
uſeful Moral, it is unreaſonable to exact the true Allegory of every little
Adventure. They may as well, when they read a Fable in <hi>Aeſop,</hi> as
ſuppoſe <hi>the Dog and the Shadow;</hi> not be ſatisfied with the

impertinent, tho' we ſhould ſuppoſe that a great many of <hi>Homer</hi>'s
Stories were deſigned for no farther uſe, than to be the neceſſary
Attendants of thoſe other Fictions which they allow to contain ſome plainer
Inſtruction. But what if it ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a fair Conjecture, that
the Poet did really ſhadow a perpetual Leſſon, in every part of the
piece, but laid a great deal of it ſo artificially, as to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
only by thoſe Perſons whom he ſhould fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with a Clue to the whole

as <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Muſaeus</hi> are ſaid to have gain'd by the
ſame Arts? And then, why might not he (like the Maſters of other Sects)
beſides the general Inſtruction to all the World, have concealed ſome
deeper Doctrine in his Verſes, deſign'd only to be known by the Tribe of

<hi>Civil Happineſs; Godfrey,</hi> and the other Heroes, each of them ſome

of ſome of his Fictions, <hi>Boſſu</hi> and <hi>Dacier</hi> will
anſwer, that the want of probability may generally be excus'd upon account of
ſome attending Circumſtance.<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99270:21"/>And that thus all the
monſtrous Relations about <hi>Circè, Polypheme,</hi> the
<hi>Syrens,</hi> &amp;c. tho' abſolutely falſe and extravagant, yet may
paſs with a good Air enough, if we conſider what ſort of People thoſe
were whom <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> entertains with ſuch Recitals. And they were
the <hi>Phaeacians,</hi> whom the Poet takes care to deſcribe, as a ſoft,
effeminate, idle Race of Mortals, living at a great diſtance from the Civil
World; and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of no other Knowledge but that of Tales and prodigious
Occurrences.</p>
               <p>This Apology carries a fair Face, and may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to
eſtabliſh <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> his Credit with his <hi>new</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
becauſe they are not likely to look ſo far as the latter end of the Poem to

Twenty third Book, where the Hero is ſaid to have oblig'd his Lady at his
return, with an Account of the ſame mad Adventures, the ſame
<hi>Polypheme,</hi> and <hi>Scylla,</hi> and <hi>Circe,</hi> which had ſo

Argument, that the ſtupidity of the <hi>Phaeaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ought not to
excuſe the extravagant abſurdity of thoſe Stories: unleſs we
ſuppoſe the Travelling Prince, after the Sight of ſo many Cities and

<hi>Penelope,</hi> and a Debauch't <hi>Alcinous.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if we may
venture to wander a little from ſuch great Guides, as <hi>Boſſu</hi> and
<hi>Dacier;</hi> the reaſon of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s Impoſſibilities in the
<hi>Odyſſey,</hi> is not to be laid on the little ſpot of
<hi>Phaeacia,</hi> but upon the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then World. Did not the Prieſts
continually amuze the ſtaring Multitude with Relations much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
than any of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> his Tales? And was not all the Philoſophy
for many Hundred Years after <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> a wilder Romance than any part of
his Poeſy? Indeed there was plain neceſſity for this old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
'Twould have been as vain an attempt to<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99270:22"/>have endeavoured the
keeping ſimple Creatures in awe by rational means, as to talk ſerious
ſence to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children. Both were to be charm'd into their Duty by Prodigy
and wonder. The Law-giver ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his Stories like the Nurſe: and the
<hi>Gorgons</hi> were as uſeful for maintaining the Quiet of Tribes and
Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, as the <hi>Bug-bears</hi> for ſecuring the peace of the
Cradle.</p>
               <p>The laſt part of the Charge againſt <hi>Homer</hi>'s Fables
is generally own'd; where a great many of them are accus'd of ſerving rather
to the encouragement of Men in Vice, than the inclining and inciting them to
Goodneſs. All the brave Advocates and Champions that his Fame holds in pay,
have not been able to guard it from this Attack. Being forc'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that thoſe unworthy repreſentations of the Celeſtial Powers which run
through every Story, muſt needs have advanc'd the Cauſe of Impiety in the
ignorant World; becauſe the unthinking part of Mankind were not able to look
behind the groſs Veil which covered theſe Sacred Matters; and ſo were
miſerably abus'd, miſtaking the deform'd and odious Shadow for the real
Beauty and Subſtance, and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt dangerous Fictions, as
ſolid and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Truths. 'Tis in vain to urge, that theſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Proceedings may be juſtified by conſidering the particular Circumſtances
of every Buſineſs. As, that the rude Scene of Love between <hi>Mars</hi>

neither the Poet nor the Hero, nor ſo much as an honeſt Man that gives the

immediately corrupting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the groſſeſt Ignorance, we may eaſily
imagine the very Principles of true Religion to have been extinguiſh'd among
them; except ſome few Reliques of Natural Maxims, which remaining in wiſer
Heads, fitted them for Law-givers and Founders of States. Now 'twas
neceſſary for theſe great Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to let the People have ſome
Apprehenſions of the ſupreme Powers of Heaven, whoſe authority was to
keep them in their Duty. But it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the abſtracted
Notion of one Eternal, Infinite, and Almighty Being, ſhould take any firm
hold on Minds guided only by the outward ſences; ſome Corporeal Images were
to be introduc'd, which might maintain a vigorous Impreſſion on the Fancy,
by the reſemblance of ſome things with which it was better acquainted. This
might be offered as a reaſon why they cloathed the Sovereign Being in a
material ſhape, before they preſented him to the adoration of the vulgar;
ſtill leaving him the Power of Inviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and of taking any new Form he
pleaſed. But now when they had diveſted the Heavenly Nature of its infinite
and uncompounded Eſſence, they found themſelves obliged, to take away the
Unity too,<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99270:23"/>the Multitude would never have ſtood in due awe
of one only Supreme Ruler in the Skies, whom they conceived in Form and Limbs
not much unlike them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nor have allow'd his Power ſo prodigious an
extent beyond his Body. Therefore, beſides the chief <hi>Jupiter,</hi> every
corner in Heaven and Earth too, was fill'd with Inferior Deities; who tho' they
were properly no more than Officers to put their Great Maſter's Pleaſure in
Execution, yet had the power of puniſhing any Crime committed in their
particular Diſtricts. But ſtill, becauſe no <hi>Divinity</hi> could have
maintain'd his force upon the People, unleſs he had his peculiar Name and
Story to run al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in their Heads, and to keep their thoughts in play: 'Twas
thought convenient to let them know that theſe Heavenly Governours were once
Mortal Princes, who for their great Services to Mankind, had merited ſo
exalted a State. And thus every God came to have his Legend, conſiſting of
the mighty Adventures he had paſs'd through during his Humane Condition. And
becauſe many of theſe Worthies liv'd at the ſame time, hence came they to
be engag'd in many common Intrigues. And from theſe aroſe their Loves,
their Flights, their Wars, their Antipathies, and Friendſhips. Thus the
Multitude arriv'd at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of theſe Adventures; the Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
encouraging their Curioſity, and retaining the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets to give it
Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>'Tis not unlikely, that the Government might hope for ſome
farther Benefit from this Indulgence, than is commonly imagin'd. For 'twas
reaſonable for them to ſuppoſe, that the People acknowledging the
<hi>Power</hi> of the Gods at the ſame time as they rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their
<hi>Failings;</hi> would, upon the ſame Principle, refuſe to take any
occaſion from the Faults of their Rulers to reſiſt their Authority. But
would conceive Gods and Princes both to act by Prerogative, and to 
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99270:23"/>have a juſt right of puniſhing the ſame Actions in
their Inferiors, which their own high Station, and their exemption from common
Duties excus'd, or juſtifi'd in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Perhaps when Learning and Arts came to be more refin'd, the
wiſe Maſters who ſat at the Helm might find the bad conſequence of
theſe Doctrines, and that the People would never grow heartily averſe to
ſinful Courſes, while they had ſo great Patrons and Examples, and could
make Heaven a partner in their Guilt. And therefore the State might again call
the Poets to its aſſiſtance, who by framing an uſeful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of
every old Story, ſhould hinder the more knowing Perſons from taking
offence; and at leaſt give an uncertain amuſement to thoſe who could not
apprehend the Expoſition.</p>
               <p>Thus without doubt in many Caſes the Fable was not <hi>caſt
on</hi> to cover the Allegorical Truth; but the Allegorical Truth <hi>ſpread
under,</hi> to disguize the Fable. For it can never be denied but that there
were once really ſuch Men as the Ancients call'd <hi>Saturn, Jupiter</hi> and
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> tho' we have had ſo many old, and ſo many new Morals to
make out the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of their Stories, and of their Names.</p>
               <p>If now it at all appears from theſe Conjectures, that the
original of the ridiculous Stories about the Gods, was not owing to the
extravagant Fancies of the Poets, but to the neceſſity of the Times, and to
the Rules of State: Can <hi>Homer</hi> be juſtly condemn'd for carrying on
the ſame Deſign with a better Grace; that is, for preſenting the old
Fictions in a new dreſs, and ſo bringing them nearer to a hidden and
Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical meaning? But indeed, ſhould he plead Guilty to the whole
Indictment, and thro himſelf on the Mercy of his Judges; 'twould be very hard
if we ſhould require the ſtricteſt Piety in the Ancient Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, while we
are forc'd to diſpenſe with it in the<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99270:24"/>Modern; if our

                  <hi>Boileau</hi> informs us, from an old lamentable
Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the <hi>Odyſſey</hi> into French. Now it's likely, that
Similitude was taken from the Sacrifices, in which we know the Fat was
eſpecially regarded. Beſides, the Bellies of ſome Animals were reckon'd
hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt delicious Meat, and much above the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Modern
Tripe.</p>
               <p>'Twere tolerable if this ſcrupulous niceneſs were only
impertinent; but 'twould be no hard matter to prove it impious too. For there
are abundance of Expreſſions in the Holy Scriptures which agree no butter
with the Genins of Modern Times and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. Thus particularly theſe two
Compariſons of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> ſeem to have
ſomething much of the ſame mode of Speech with them, in the Bible.

reaſon of which Name could be nothing elſe, but their conſiſting of a

ſame Title. Secondly, that we don't know the Country of <hi>Homer;</hi> and
that therefore it is probable, every one of thoſe Cities which laid claim to
his Birth, had really produc'd one of thoſe petit Poets, who compos'd ſome

               <p>Now, as to the firſt of theſe Objections, what a ſurprize
Monſieur <hi>Perrault</hi> would be in, if he ſhould be told, that the word

con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this Notion. We may venture therefore to grant, that the word

Jeoffrey Chaucer,</hi> becauſe he is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for by ſeveral Counties,
and adjudg'd certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to none.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Perrault</hi> is ſo much a Gentleman, as at laſt
to ſuppoſe that <hi>Homer</hi> might indeed make the Forty eight Books,
which we find in the <hi>Iliad</hi> and the <hi>Odyſſey;</hi> but then he
ſays 'tis almoſt beyond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute that he never form'd thoſe entire
Poems. What in his Judgment puts this matter <hi>almoſt beyond
diſpute,</hi> is a paſſage of <hi>Aelian</hi>'s various Hiſtory; which 
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99270:26"/>indeed in <hi>Perrault</hi>'s Words prove; what he
deſires; but in <hi>Aelian</hi>'s quite contradicts and ſpoils the whole
Buſineſs. He draws the Argument after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Aelian,</hi> whoſe Teſtimony is by no means
contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, plainly tells us, 'twas the Judgment of the Ancient Criticks,
that <hi>Homer</hi> never compos'd the <hi>Iliad</hi> and the
<hi>Odyſſey</hi> any otherwiſe than in little ſcraps, without any unity
of Deſign. And that he gave no other Name to theſe particular pieces (which
he made without order or method, in the heat of his imagination) but the title
of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that they treated of: that he call'd the Song, which afterward
made the firſt Book of the Iliad, <hi>The anger of</hi> Achilles; <hi>The
numbring of the Veſſels,</hi> that which was turn'd into the Second Book.
The Combat of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Menelaus,</hi> that which we have for the
Third Book, and ſo of the reſt. He adds, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the
<hi>Lacedemonian</hi> was the firſt who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried theſe ſeparate pieces
into <hi>Greece;</hi> and that 'twas <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> who modell'd
them, as we are ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and who made the Iliad and the Odyſſey, in the
manner we now ſee them, conſiſting of Four and twenty Books, in Honour of
the Four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Letters of the Alphabet.</q>
               <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Perrault,</hi> after his haughty and dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
manner, has made <hi>Aelian</hi> ſpeak in his Citation; and now 'tis ſit

               <p>This account, tho' it ſeems to include no other Labours but
the EPTA and the <hi>THEOGONY,</hi> yet agrees with neither of the Pieces which
we now have, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe Names. For thoſe fine things which the Latin Poet
recount's about the Birth of the Gods, and the making of the World, are not
ſo nearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li'd to any paſſages in the preſent <hi>THEOGONY</hi> as
to juſtifie the alluſion. And therefore 'till the late moſt Learned and
Ingenious Tranſlator of <hi>Manilius</hi> ſhall oblige us with his
corrections of this place in a Latin Edition, it muſt be concluded; that
either the Aſtronomer's Fancy has carried him beyond his Aim: or elſe, that
<hi>Heſiod</hi> compos'd ſome other Poem <hi>of the Genealogy of the
Gods,</hi> which might be extant in thoſe Times.</p>
               <p>And then the other part of the Relation, which is taken up with
deſcribing the Arts of Planting can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not on any account, be referr'd to the
EPTA, where that part of Husbandry is entirely wanting; or at leaſt but
ſlightly touch'd; If, after this we conſider that <hi>Virgil</hi> propos'd
<hi>Heſiod</hi>

                  </note> for his Pattern in the ſecond of his
<hi>Georgics,</hi> which contains the <hi>Care of Trees,</hi> we may imagin
that <hi>Heſiod</hi> wrote ſome other Pieces of Ruſtical Affairs, which
<hi>Virgil</hi> might rather imitate; and that the EPTA and HMHPAI are not ſo
properly a Treatiſe of Agriculture, as a Body of Oeconomics: a Point, which
<hi>Daniel Henſius</hi> has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a long Diſcourſe to prove.</p>
               <p>Theſe EPTA and HMHPAI being the only unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Work of
<hi>Heſiod,</hi> as has been obſerv'd, muſt, to<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99270:36"/>us, be
the main Foundation of his Character and Eſteem. It's true indeed, that
<hi>Quintilian</hi> gives him the Palm only <hi>in med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

it muſt be conſider'd that his Subjects oblig'd him to riſe no higher.
And that too gave occaſion to the Remark of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> the
<hi>Spartan,</hi> that <hi>Homer</hi> was the Poet of the
<hi>Lacaedemonians,</hi> and <hi>Heſiod</hi> of the <hi>Ilotes,</hi> or the
Slaves: becauſe the firſt taught the Art of War, and the other the Art of
Husbandry. A ſaying much like that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that
<hi>Homer</hi> was fit for Kings, and <hi>Heſiod</hi> only for Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
Carpenters and Ploughmen.</p>
               <p>Yet his Reputation need not be built on a better bottom, than
the ſucceſs of thoſe Pieces: where the ſweet and eaſie plainneſs of
Stile; that Air of the Graveſt Virtue; thoſe Fables pleaſantly told and
uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully applied; together with that ineſtimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of unaffected
Moral Precepts, will always juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and ſecure that Elogy which
<hi>Paterculus</hi> and <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> ſo long ſince gave him, of being
the next Poet to <hi>Homer,</hi> as well in the value of his Works, as in the

               <p>The Maſters of Controverſial Philology are utterly
diſappointed when <hi>Anacreon</hi> falls under their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſs. He deprives
them of all their Common Places of Talk. They can produce, no tedious Labours,
on the Occaſions of his Poems; becauſe they were all perfect Humours. They
can neither diſpute what Examples he follow'd, nor who have follow'd his
Example: becauſe the Natural delicacy of his Pieces diſdains a Copier, as
much as it did a Pattern. Would they contend about his Numbers, or his Stile;
they are both too equal to found a difference. Or would they, as their laſt
Refuge oppoſe one Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency againſt another; the Virtues of his Poeſy,
are more cloſely united than thoſe of the Moraliſts; and his Graces being
all born together, it were unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to divide them. The nice Judges may
ſafely pleaſe themſelves, with admiring each a particular Beauty. One may
celebrate the happy novelty of his thoughts: Another the agreeable fineneſs
of his Turns; a third the moving ſoftneſs of his Expreſſions; and many
more declare in favour, either of his Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or of his Juſtneſs, or of
his Simplicity, or of his Muſical Cadences; or of whatever they think touches
them with moſt advantage. But were they all oblig'd to deſcribe the Powers
that had charm'd them; they might very probably appear better Friends than they
deſir'd.</p>

               <p>Monſieur <hi>Perrault</hi> in his late Parralel, as he has
manag'd the Charge againſt all the Celebrated Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99270:45"/>of
Antiquity, ſo he has been particularly ſevere upon <hi>Pindar;</hi> and
given him leſs Quarter than the reſt. He cenſures him as 
<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>a ſpeaker of impenetrable
Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limathies</hi> (or extravagant flights) <hi>ſuch as no Man could ever
underſt and, and ſuch as <hi>Horace</hi> ſlily ſcouted when he call'd
him inimitable.</hi>
                  </q> In ſhort, to keep on his Cuſtom of beginning with
bold ſtrokes, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the firſt Verſes in the firſt Ode to be
unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Nonſence; and from that Specimen would have us frame our
Notions of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>The moſt admirable <hi>Boileau,</hi> who in his
<hi>Reflexions</hi> on <hi>Longinus,</hi> has done <hi>Perrault</hi> the honour
of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation; is pleas'd to ſet this paſſage in its true light, and
to make it ſo clear, as even his <hi>Adverſary</hi> might underſtand it.
He tells us, we muſt remember that <hi>Pindar</hi> liv'd in the next times to
<hi>Thales, Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> the Famous Natural
Philoſophers; who had taught with ſo great ſucceſs. The Opinion of
<hi>Thales,</hi> who made <hi>Water</hi> the firſt <hi>Principle</hi> of
Things was in particular eſteem. Now <hi>Empedocles</hi> the
<hi>Sicilian,</hi> Scholar to <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and Cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with
<hi>Pindar,</hi> had carried matters farther than any of them: and had not only
penetrated very deep into the Knowledge of Nature, but (as <hi>Lucretius</hi>
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards did) had adorn'd the whole Science in Verſe. This Poem rais'd his
Character to ſuch a pitch in <hi>Greece,</hi> that they ſcarce thought him
of Mortal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent. The entire Work has long ſince periſh'd; but there's
a Tradition that it began with the praiſes of the <hi>Elements;</hi> and 'tis
not likely the formation of Gold and other Mettals ſhould be left untouch'd.
Now <hi>Pindar</hi> being to compoſe his firſt <hi>Olympick</hi> Ode in
honour of King <hi>Hiero,</hi> who had won the Prize at the Horſe-race,
begins with the moſt ſimple and the moſt natural thought in the World.
That, if he were inclin'd to ſing of the Wonders of Nature, then in imitation
of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> he would celebrate <hi>Water</hi>

having conſecrated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is Muſe to
the Praiſes of Men, he reſolv'd to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Olympick Games, which
were the Nobleſt Exerciſes of Mankind. And that to ſay there was any
other Conteſt ſo Noble as the Olympick, was the ſame thing, as to pretend
that there was ſome other Luminary in Heaven of equal Glory with the Sun.
This is <hi>Pindar</hi>'s thought in it's Natural order, and as a Rhetorician
would have expreſs'd it in exact Proſe: let us ſee now how
<hi>Pindar</hi> has ſet it off in Verſe.

laying a general Accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, for little leſs than downright
diſtraction. They build this ſcandal on his unaccountable Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and the furious rambles of his Wit. They think it the higheſt pitch of raving
abſurdity; while they ſee him addreſſing one of his Odes to ſome
Great Man, and pretending to celebrate his Victory; when perhaps he preſently
runs off to ſome fabulous Adventure of the Gods or ancient Heroes, and
ſcarce ſpares time to give his Patron a parting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment in the
Concluſion. The common Anſwer to this Impeachment is drawn from the nature
of <hi>Pindar</hi>'s way of Writing: this Libertiniſm of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct being the
very Life and Soul of his Pieces. On which account Monſieur
<hi>Boileau</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">

               <p>It's plain <hi>Pindar</hi> was ſenſible of his hardineſs,
in wandring ſo looſly from the main Subject. And therefore after a long
heat of any forreign Story, we find him very often, reprehending his Muſe for

                  </q> But
this might not be with deſign to beg pardon, but to ſhow his skill. For, as
he took an extraordinary delight in uſing this Metaphor of <hi>Quiver and
Arrows</hi> for his<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99270:47"/>Wit, ſo 'twas his Privilege, to let

                     </l>
                  </q>In his Tenth Pythique he plead's his Title to this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99270:48"/>this Cauſe. To ſay, that 'twas the <hi>manner</hi> or
the <hi>way</hi> of thoſe Odes to be ſo bold and ſo Licentious, while
this <hi>manner,</hi> or this <hi>way</hi> is the very thing that the
Adverſaries complain of. But if it could be tolerably made out, that
beſides the hardy freedom of his Genius, he was upon account of his Subjects,
in a great meaſure oblig'd to this Conduct; then the Cavil muſt
neceſſary fall, or at leaſt be transferr'd from the Poet to the Times.
Yet, upon a fair Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this would be no difficult Task. For we ought to
conſider that theſe <hi>Odes of Victory</hi> were all compos'd to be ſung
by a <hi>Chorus</hi> of Men at Publick Feſtivals and Meetings, aſſiſted
with the advantages of Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Muſick. If any queſtion the truth of
this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Pindar</hi> himſelf will ſatisfie them, in
almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Piece. But in the 10th of the Olympiques he will give them an
account how the Cuſtom of theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrical Hymns came to be introduced,
and how he deſigns to carry it on. He has been deſcribing the Inſtitution
of the Olympian Games by <hi>Hercules,</hi> and reckoning up the Victories in
the ſeveral Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at their firſt Celebration. Whom, when their
Labours were finiſh'd, he make's to have been thus entertain'd.

               <p>Now it would have been an invidious, as well as a tireſom
buſineſs, to fill a Hymn that was deſign'd for General Entertainment,
with the direct Praiſes of a ſingle Man: and, now and then, of a Man, not 
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99270:49"/>very eminent on any other account, but for his good Fortune
in winning the Prize at ſome of the Publick Exerciſes. But the Old
Relations of the Acts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Heaven-born Heroes, were what every Body
long'd for and admir'd; eſpecially when they heard them given with new
improvements of Wit and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Therefore, as to this Conduct,
<hi>Pindar</hi>'s Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ought rather to admire the ſtrength of his
Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than rail at the Wildneſs of his Fancy. And eſpecially, ſince,
whatever they may pretend, his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions are ſeldom forced in without
occaſion. The Gods or Conſecrated Heroes do not intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
uncivilly into a Poem where they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. The Gentleman whom
<hi>Pindar</hi> particularly addreſſes, has commonly ſome near relation
to them: They are either the Founders of his City, or of his Family, or the
Inſtitutors of the Games in which he has Conquer'd: Or famous for ſome of
thoſe Virtues, which the Poet celebrates in his Patron.</p>
               <p>But the trouble might have been ſpar'd of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formally
to anſwer theſe two Objections. For, as ſilly or malicious Accuſers
generally ſpoil their whole Charge by endeavoring to heighten and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
it; ſo the ſame nice Palats, which cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Pindar</hi> on the
ſcores already mention'd, plainly ſhow where the Diſtemper lies, by
adding a farther Reaſon of their Diſguſt. Their formidable Champion
<hi>Perrault</hi> is not aſham'd to bring this as an Argument of the little
Merit of <hi>Pindar</hi>'s Works, that their chief Uſe is to furniſh Great
Readers and Collectors with a ſtock of Moral Sentences. And now we may
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any one, whether <hi>Envy</hi> has not been very unhappy, to pitch
on an unqueſtion'd Virtue for a Crime. For till Profit and Inſtruction are
denied to be the main ends of Poetry; <hi>Pindar,</hi> even according to this
Judgment, has a fair Title at leaſt to half the Laurels; while he is
acknowledg'd to advance the Work of Virtue in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:99270:49"/>Indeed, if a Man conſider'd carefully our
igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in thoſe things which were the foundation of <hi>Pindar</hi>'s
Writings, the various Ceremonies of the Games, and the particularities of
Times, Perſons and Places; beſides our weak Notions of his Language and
Numbers: he would be apt to ſix his <hi>Morality,</hi> for a much ſurer as
well as a much Nobler Praiſe than what we can pretend at this diſtance to
build on the excellencies of his <hi>Manners</hi> and of his <hi>Style.
That</hi> will turn to <hi>Uſe</hi> when <hi>theſe</hi> are only
<hi>admir'd.</hi> If we can't copy the Beauties of his Fancy we may improve by
the ſtrength of his Wiſdom, to which his Fancy lent it's Charms. If his
Spirit of Poetry diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to be within our reach, his Spirit of Honeſty and
Goodneſs will admit a more eaſie Imitation: And tho' we cannot ſoar
beyond the Clouds, with his Wit; we may make a nobler <hi>Flight,</hi> by the
aſſiſtance of his Piety.</p>
               <p>Now not to make a Catalogue of all the excellent Paſſages we
meet with in <hi>Pindar,</hi> concerning the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Eſtate of Good and
Bad Men after this Life, the juſt inequality of the Diſtributions of
Providence, and the incapacity of Men to judge of the Actions of Heaven; with

               <p>It's generally agreed that Tragedy was at firſt no more than a

convenient to add one Perſon above the Chorus, who to relieve them and give
them Breath might entertain the Audience with the Recital of ſome
Illuſtrious Adventure. Now <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> as ſoon as ever he came to
compare theſe rude Eſſays with his own deſign; found that this ſingle
<hi>Perſon</hi> tired the Audience more than he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed the Chorus. And
therefore he divided the <hi>Action</hi> between many <hi>Perſons;</hi> one
of which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally honour'd with the Principal Character, and the reſt
were the Attendants of his Story and of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Thus, as Monſieur
<hi>Dacier</hi> obſerves, this part of Tragedy which was at firſt
introduc'd only as an agreeable Relief, came to be the Principal Deſign; and
the <hi>Chorus</hi> for the future ſerv'd only to eaſe the
<hi>Perſons,</hi> as the <hi>Perſon</hi> had been firſt admitted to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the <hi>Chorus.</hi> Before <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> the Actors had not

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:99270:53"/>were contented
with the Moveable Stage of a Cart. But <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> as he chang'd
their open Scene to a Theatre, ſo he furniſh'd them with a Maſque,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of their rude Diſguize of Soot and Lie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he ſet them
off with the proper Ornaments of Dreſs, agreeable to the ſeveral Characters
they were to ſuſtain; and by the aſſiſtance of Buskins advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them
to the fancied pitch and ſize of Heroes<note n="a" place="bottom">

               <p>Yet, after all theſe Honourable Performances, he has found (as

which <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides</hi> afterwards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. His
Deſigns are cenſur'd, as Extravagant; his Conduct as rude and ſimple; and

                  <hi>Dacier</hi> has propos'd two ways of aſſigning
their proper Characters; the firſt in relation to their Style, which he
borrows from <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus;</hi> and the other on account
of the different ſpecies of Tragedy: how each Man ſucceeded beſt in
ſome particular kind. As for Stile, he attributes the <hi>rude</hi> to
<hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> the <hi>Florid</hi> to <hi>Euripides,</hi> and the mixt
to <hi>Sophocles.</hi> In the diviſion of Tragedy; he takes

pathetique: Sophocles</hi> to have done beſt in the <hi>implexe,</hi> and
<hi>Euripides</hi> in the <hi>Moral.</hi> Both theſe Diſtinctions, how true
ſoever they may be, yet as they divide the Laurel are like to give

profeſſes after all, that he ſhall be oblig'd to any Perſon who would

ſhould<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99270:54"/>be remembred, that his buſineſs lay among the

Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in their Voice and Tone. Beſides, thoſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Worthies were

who venturing nothing, go on gravely in the plain Road, lie under no great
Danger of Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying. While the more exalted Path is ſtill the more

Perſons of Heroes to ſtoop to Trifles.</p>
               <p>If Inſtruction be acknowleg'd for the Chief End of Poetry,
<hi>Aeſchylus</hi>'s Pieces may paſs for Moral Lectures, as well as thoſe
of <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides.</hi> And though he may not
poſſibly have had Art<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99270:54"/>enough to dreſs up Virtue in all
her Ornaments and her Charms; yet he has certainly diſplay'd Vice, in it's
moſt horrible Shapes: as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed eaſier for him to Paint a Monſter
than a Beauty.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time it muſt be acknowledg'd that he
underſtood little of what was afterwards call'd Nature and Fineneſs: But
that poſſeſſing a vaſt and elevated Fancy, he endeavour'd by the
force of Prodigies and Fables to aſtoniſh and Terrifie the Audience, whom
he could not entertain agreeably by the Rules of Decency and Art. To this
purpoſe, they tell a famous Story, that when his <hi>Eumenides</hi> was
Acted, the <hi>Chorus</hi> of <hi>Furies</hi> entring in a violent manner on
the Stage, the People were put into ſuch a Fright, that the Children Swoon'd

               <p>Yet even in this Care of making Terror the Chief End of his
Pieces, he ſeems not ſo much to have been out in the Choice as in the
Proſecution of his Deſign. For, however the ſoft movement of the
Paſſions may have uſurped the chief place in Tragedy, it is certain the
Audience ought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be tranſported as well as gently agitated.

allowing the Chorus an Intereſt in the main Action, ſo as to make the Play
all of a piece; every thing conducing regularly to the chief Deſign. Whereas
in <hi>Euripides</hi> we often meet with a rambling Song of the Chorus,
intirely independent of the main Buſineſs, and as proper to be us'd on any
other Subject or Occaſion whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Indeed the ſtiffeſt Patrons of <hi>Euripides</hi> are

to the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Friend. At the ſame time, the Applauders
of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> will come to no Compoſition, nor yield the leaſt
part of the Tragick Laurels to the pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the oppoſite Party. Or
now and then, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if they are in a Generous Fit, they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<hi>Euripides</hi> to have attain'd a Clearneſs and Happineſs of Stile; but
then it muſt ariſe from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler means: And what <hi>Sophocles</hi> owe's
only to the force of Genius and the Native loftineſs of thought, his Rival
muſt faintly imitate, by an exactneſs of care, and a skilful ranging of
Words and Sentences. The Compoſitions of <hi>Sophocles</hi> muſt reliſh
of the World, while thoſe of <hi>Euripides</hi> betray the harſher twang of
the School. <hi>Thoſe</hi> muſt be the beſt Tragedies, <hi>theſe</hi>

the greateſt Poet, and <hi>Euripides</hi> the greateſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</p>
               <p>Now, if there were room for a moderate Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho' the Palm
would perhaps be divided more equally, yet <hi>Sophocles</hi> would ſtill

had the hardineſs to declare poſitively on either ſide; except one or
two, who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Sophocles</hi> with the Title of <hi>Prince of

                  <hi>Sophocles</hi> and he, as the Two Great Maſters of the
ſame Trade, are commonly thought to have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd no great Intimacy; at

ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd to <hi>Sophocles,</hi> who was then in the Iſland
<hi>Chios;</hi> congratulating his ſafety after a Ship-wreck; and condoling
the loſs of his Tragedies by that Accident, as a Common Misfortune to
<hi>Greece;</hi> yet ſuch as might eaſily be repair'd, in as much as the
Worthy Author of them ſurviv'd. If this Epiſtle be genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, there was
without doubt a fair underſtanding at laſt between theſe Great Perſons:
a point, which will be confirm'd farther when we come to take notice of
<hi>Sophocles</hi>'s Behaviour upon the News of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi>'s

               <p>His Humour and Carriage are repreſented as Grave and Serious,

               <p>As to Love-matters, the common Buſineſs of his

appearing Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction may be eaſily ſalv'd. His continual Care to fill

<hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> in one of his Comedies ſet a Jury of Women to try
him, for his Offences in that kind. Yet this does not in the leaſt hinder,
but that he might admire the Good part of the Fair World, as much as he

               <p>Indeed, his Death is generally charg'd upon the King's Dogs: but
whether this happen'd thro' Envy of ſome of the Courtiers, or by meer chance,
is very far from a determination. Every Account gives him the ſame
unfortunate End; and yet differs from the reſt, in the particular manner of
the Action. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome, indeed, will not have him to have been torn in pieces
by Dogs, but by a Mob of Women; as Old <hi>Orpheus</hi> had ſuffer'd before
him. <hi>Suidas</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the time of his Death in the 93d Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad; and

                  <hi>Plutarch,</hi> then, had good reaſon to aſſign WISDOM,
as the peculiar Character and Glory of <hi>Euripides</hi>'s Works. For tho' the
other Tragedians propoſe the ſame end, the regulating of Mens Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about Providence and Human Affairs, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting Vice in all it's
deformities and Miſchiefs, and the painting Virtue, with the higheſt
Beauties, and with the beſt rewards: yet he will always appear to have
anſwer'd that Deſign with ſo much the more advantage; as he added the
ſtrength of Philoſophy, to the powers of Action and of Verſe. For thus by
a courſe of frequent Sentences, he inſtils all his Good Principles and
Counſels, by the immediate convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Ear. Whereas in the other
Tragick<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99270:67"/>Pieces, the People were inſtructed more by what
they ſaw, than by what they heard. The whole Action and Scope of the Play
might perhaps recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſome Noble Virtue to their Practice: becauſe they
beheld either that Virtue thriving happily in ſome Great Perſon, or the
contrary Vice procuring as remarkable Misfortunes. But this was rather
teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Picture and dumb ſhow, than by Words and Precepts. While the
Written part was all ſpent in bringing about and adjuſting the Intrigue,
without intermixing many new Advices, for fear of retarding the Grand Deſign.
But now <hi>Euripides,</hi> beſides their Advantage of ſhadowing one great
Duty by the main Action, has inſerted a long train of inferior Rules; and has
given theſe in direct words to the Audience, without putting them to the
trouble of making inferences from what they ſee. And tho' the firſt of
theſe ways, may be thought the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Inſtruction; the other
will be admitted as the moſt uſeful; or at leaſt as the moſt ſuitable
to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>'Tis on the account of this Wiſdom, and this forcible way of
teaching, that <hi>Quintilian,</hi> when he is giving his Young Orator a Liſt
of Authors, with their proper Characters and Uſes: while he does but juſt
mention <hi>Sophocles</hi>'s Name, paſſes on preſently to a long
recommendation of <hi>Euripides,</hi> as far the moſt beneficial to a Man,
who deſign'd to rule the <hi>Forum.</hi> His Language, which ſome
reprehend, as inferiour to the Grandeur of the Buskin, the Rhetorician for the
ſame reaſon, eſteems and applauds, as approaching nearer to the ſtile
of Oratory. Then, as to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py abundance of his Sentences, and his
delivering the Grave Precepts of the Ancient Sages, he thinks him almoſt
equal to the Wiſe Maſters themſelves: and in his Speeches and Anſwers,
comparable to the moſt commanding Pleader at the Bar. And ends 
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99270:68"/>his Character with the moſt taking part of it, the
excellency of his Paſſions, and his unreſiſtable force of raiſing
Pitty.</p>
               <p>None can deny, but that the Virtues and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which
<hi>Quintilian</hi> here recommends to his Orator's Imitation, will have their
uſe and value in proportion, with all Perſons who are engag'd in the
Buſineſs of the World. They will be better Citizens by reading
<hi>Euripides,</hi> and better Verſifiers by doating on <hi>Sophocles:</hi>
and will acknowledge juſt as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the advantages they
receive from thoſe two Authors, as they find between their Civil, and their
Poetick Capacity.</p>
               <p>Not but that <hi>Sophocles</hi> has his Inſtructions too, and
thoſe the moſt curious and the moſt refin'd. But, alaſs! his very
excellencies render him of leſs ſervice to the World. All the Old Magick of
Poeſy has been long ſince concluded: and the Muſes may as well expect
again to draw Stones and Trees into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as Men into Virtue, by their Arts
and Power. People are no more, to be led into Societies: like Bees, by the
force of Muſick. The World, in its Infancy, might learn Goodneſs, by
ſweet Violences, and pleaſant Deceits. But now, it pretends to be more
Manly; and ſcorns to be trick'd, tho' to its own Advantage. We as much
deſpiſe a Poet, who hopes to enforce Virtue by the Harmony and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of
Verſe; as a Phyſician who endeavours to cure by Charm. Things muſt be
laid down in a plain way, and the courſe and method of Nature exactly
follow'd. If Virtue and Vice <hi>will</hi> come upon the Stage, they muſt lay
aſide their Scenical Habits, and appear Naked and Unmaſqu'd. Otherwiſe we
are apt to take the Liberty of thinking that they only indeed Act a Part, and
are juſt ſuch Machines and Fancies in the World, as they are in the
Theatre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:99270:68"/>Thus while <hi>Euripides,</hi> does not
ſo much endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prevail on our ſences, as to make an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Conqueſt on our Minds; and rather convinces us by Eloquence, than amazes us
by Pomp and Show: We admire and eſteem him more, the more he has fail'd in
the formal Rules of his Art: and are ready to acknowledge him the chief of
Tragick Profeſſors, becauſe he kindly deſcends to our Level, and wears
his Buskins lower than the reſt.</p>

and by, his Relation is to this purpoſe. <hi>Anytus</hi> and the other
Accuſers who had form'd a Deſign againſt <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Credit and
Life, were not ſo ſenceleſs as to imagine, that the Judges would be very
willing to receive an Impeachment of the Wiſeſt and the Beſt of Men. And
therefore they concluded it would be the beſt way of proceeding to prepare
the Minds of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> by raiſing the Scandal by Degrees. In
order to this, they hir'd <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> with the conſideration of
a good round Summ, to expoſe the Philoſopher on the Stage. They
inſtructed him too which way to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Satyr. To repreſent
<hi>Socrates</hi> as an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Virtuoſo, and a trifling Diſputant;
one that could argue <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> at his Pleaſure, and prove
Right Wrong, and Wrong Right in the ſame Breath: And eſpecially to hint at
his introducing new kinds of Daemons, and Powers unheard of before, as if he
ſlighted the Common Deities, and the preſent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their
Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:99270:71"/>
                  <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> who had no more
honeſty than his Poverty would allow, eaſily ſwallow'd the Bribe; and
falling to work according to their directions, compos'd the Comedy of the
<hi>Clouds.</hi> The <hi>Athenians,</hi> who expected nothing leſs than to
ſee ſuch a Great Man ridiculouſly perſonated in the Theatre, at firſt
were in a general wonder and ſurprize. But being naturally envious, and apt
to detract from thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe Learning or Vertue had rais'd them
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the common Level; they were afterwards tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the pleaſant
Satyr; and gave the Prize to <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> with univerſal
Applauſe.</p>
               <p>On the Faith of <hi>Aetian,</hi> we commonly build our Notions
of this Tranſaction: And agree to condemn all <hi>Athens</hi> of as much
Folly and Madneſs for approving the Poet's Slanders, as we do the Poet
himſelf for venting them. Even the moſt ingenious <hi>Madam Dacier,</hi>
who has lately given us the two firſt of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophanes</hi>'s Comedies
in ſo fine a Dreſs; is not ſo kind as to vindicate the Credit of the
Philoſopher, or the Judgement of the Audience: While obſerving only<note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>In Pref.</bibl>
                  </note> that there was no need of
corrupting the Poet with a Bribe, She ſeems to admit the reſt of
<hi>Aelians</hi>'s Story as a true Relation. But how will the Scene be alter'd,
if, after all, the Divine Philoſopher ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have been
vindicated by the Common Voice of the Judges: while the profane Poet was ſo
far diſcountenanced, as to ſee the Comick Prize given to a much Inferior
Performer? Yet as fair a Conjecture as this may be drawn from the Play it
ſelf, as we now have it. For that <hi>Parabaſis</hi> inſerted in the
Chorus between the firſt and ſecond Acts<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Pag.
156.</bibl>
                  </note>, is nothing elſe but a direct Addreſs, made by the Poet
to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, commending himſelf, as the moſt experienc'd Man in his Art,
and this for the beſt of all his Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And at the ſame time complaining
of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs;<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99270:72"/>kindneſs; that, with all theſe
advantages, they ſhould before deſpiſe and damn his Play, and deny him
the publick Teſtimony and Reward. Now the Old Scholiaſts agree to expound
this of the ill ſucceſs which the <hi>Clouds</hi> met with at their firſt
Preſenting; when <hi>Cratinus</hi> and <hi>Amipſias</hi> were Crown'd for
the beſt Comedians; and <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> exploded with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Scorn. 'Twas very Natural for the Poet, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt Misfortune, to
correct his Beloved Peice againſt a ſecond Trial; and to add this Speech,
by way of expoſtulation with the Audience; and to beg a more favourable
Sentence: And therefore it may well ſerve for a Prologue, according to the
preſent Laws of the Theatre, as Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> has plac'd it in her
Tranſlation.</p>
               <p>So far then the whole Body of the <hi>Athenians</hi> are
juſtified, that they did not encourage the Poet's firſt Attempt, in
expoſing their Great Maſter and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor. But if it could be made out
farther, that this Piece was never reviv'd on the Stage, tho' corrected by the
Author; they would come off with Honour from the whole Accuſation. Yet this
Point too will admit of a probable Proof in their Defence. For one of the old

Queſtion to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of a deciſion, whether or no the <hi>Clouds</hi>

exploded, when it came on the Stage; this is enough to alleviate in a great
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the heavy Cenſure, which has lain ſo many Ages on the
<hi>Athenian</hi> Auditory; and to ſhow that <hi>Aelian</hi> was more a Lover
of <hi>Socrates</hi> than of Truth; when to advance the Character of the
Philoſopher's Patience and Magnanimity, he traduc'd the Vertue and the Sence
of the whole City. There is one part of his Narration yet behind, which may be
prov'd groſsly falſe; and will therefore put a better Colour on our
Suſpicion of the reſt. He would perſwade us that the Accuſers of

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:99270:74"/>But if each ſide were ſo generous, as to retreat a few
ſteps, the difference might poſſibly admit ſome Accomodation. For while
the firſt abſolutely deny, and the other as poſitively affirms, the
<hi>Middle</hi> Comedy to have had a <hi>Chorus,</hi> it might be maintain'd
between both, that the <hi>Middle</hi> Species had indeed ſome kind of
<hi>Chorus,</hi> but ſo moderated and ſo reſtrain'd, that <hi>Horace</hi>
might properly ſay it <hi>was ſhamefully ſilenced,</hi> while it only lay
under this Confinement. And thus both ſides will be acknowledg'd portly in
the right: <hi>Dacier</hi> while he aſſerts a <hi>Chorus</hi> in the
<hi>Middle</hi> Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and the other Criticks when they tell us that the
taking away the injurious Liberty of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted (in a
great meaſure) the Second Species of Comedy; and not the Third. Every one
knows that the main opportunity which the <hi>Chorus</hi> had to abuſe
particular Perſons, and to talk ſaucily of the Government, was in the
<hi>Intermedes,</hi> or the long Speeches between the Acts. Now theſe being
enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely Baniſh'd in the <hi>Middle</hi> Comedy; the <hi>Chorus</hi> might

him by <hi>Action,</hi> than by Words. For in the <hi>Plutus,</hi> but now
mention'd, which is own'd for the laſt and the moſt Reform'd of his Pieces,
he has ſeverely reflected on ſeveral Perſons, and thoſe of the
higheſt Rank; and has nam'd them too in the Cenſure.</p>
               <p>If a Man was to attempt a Character of
<hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi>'s Comedies in our Times, he would certainly begin with
telling us, that we muſt not expect there, the Nicety of Rules, and the
regular Conduct, which has added ſo many Graces to the Modern Stage. For in
all his Pieces except the <hi>Plutus</hi> and the <hi>Clouds,</hi> the new
Criticks might look in vain for their <hi>Unities</hi> and their
<hi>Ordonnance;</hi> which perhaps was one reaſon why Madam <hi>Dacier</hi>
thought none of the reſt fit to be put in her Country Garb: becauſe in them
only he ſeems as much a French Man in Contrivance, as her Tranſlation makes
him in Language. Tho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt her main Argument for ſtopping at
theſe Two, was, becauſe all the reſt ſmell ſo ſtrongly of the Rude
and Debauch'd Original of the Art, as very often to offend the Chaſtity of
Common Ears; and much more the Modeſty of a Lady.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch,</hi> whoſe Sence and Judgment are as much
reſpected and admir'd as any thing in Antiquity, has left a moſt heavy
Charge againſt <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi>'s Writings; in his Compariſon of him
and <hi>Menander.</hi> Were the intire Piece extant, we might have ſome hopes
of mollifying the Sentence, by ſome more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable part of the
Diſcourſe. But in the Epitome of it, which we now have among his Moral
Works, the Cenſure ſtands very ſevere. The chief Crimes he objects
againſt our Poet, are, that he makes uſe of baſe, ſcurrilous and
nauſeous Language; and now and then affects a Tragical inſtead of a
Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Stile. That he obſerves not the difference of the Perſons that
ſpeak, nor applies thoughts and words accordingly; but without any Nature or
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum, brings in Gods, Heroes, Kings, Citizens, Old Men and Women, Fathers
and Sons, all ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like one another, in their Phraſe and Talk, that
they have nothing in the World to diſtinguiſh them but their Habit. That
his Jokes wound and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate inſtead of Curing. That he never attempts any
Character, but he is ſure to ſpoil it: While, if he's to repreſent a
Cunning Fellow, he does not<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99270:76"/>make him Politick, but
down-right Wicked: If a Countryman, inſtead of deſcribing Ignorance and
Caution, he gives us the Picture of a meer Fool: If he raiſes Laughter in the
Audience, it proceeds from the dulneſs of the Jeſt, and is directed not
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Subject but againſt the Poet: And, if he's to deſcribe the
ſoft Paſſion of Love, from Mirth and Gaiety, he turns it to looſneſs,
and immodeſt Freedom.</p>
               <p>Now the greateſt part of this Accuſation, may be eaſily
wip'd off from the Poet and thrown upon the Times. The Old Comedy, we know, had
then the Command of the Stage: And all the nauſeous kinds of obſcene
Ribaldry were as eſſential to that, as Nature and Decency were to the
<hi>New.</hi> The ſeverity of Jeſts was their main Beauty: And tho' this
might (as he ſays) ulcerate and wound the Perſon expos'd, yet to be ſure,
it did not ſail to tickle the Envious Audience. He ſeems a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
when he charges the Poet's Jokes with Dulneſs, whereas there are many the
moſt merry and divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World. But ſuppoſing they did not take
in ſo polite an Age as <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s: this is no reaſon why they
might not make an Old <hi>Grecian</hi> Audience burſt with Laughter, while
the Genius of the Times admitted nothing elſe for Wit. We ſee
<hi>Horace</hi> ſcouts the Jeſts of <hi>Plautus</hi> which were the Wonder
of his Fore-fathers: And the Caſe is the ſame with our <hi>Chaucer:</hi>
That being now applicable enough to either of the three, which an Ingenious
Gentleman obſerves of the laſt;

               </p>
               <p>What <hi>Plutarch</hi> objects farther of the Poet's not
obſerving the Rule of applying the proper Language and Manners to each Sex
and every Age and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99270:76"/>is grounded on as bad a
bottom. For this was a Perfection of the <hi>New</hi> Comedy; but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
with univerſal allowance in the Old. Not that ſuch a Liberty juſtified
abſolute Contradictions in the ſame Character; but only the ſtraining of
that Character ſomething beyond Nature and Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to ſurprize and
amuſe the Spectators. Thus we find ſuch Thoughts and Words, and Deſigns
given to a Parcel of Manniſh Strumpets, as would almoſt exceed the true
Boldneſs of the other Sex. Thus we ſee an ill-manner'd Citizen, painted
with the Blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Stupidity of a Ruſtick: And the Grave
<hi>Socrates</hi> repreſented with as great a mixture of Folly and Madneſs,
as our Sir <hi>Nicholas Gimcrack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That part of the Charge too muſt be confeſs'd, where
<hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> is ſaid to affect in many places, a Tragick Style.
But then 'twill be as eaſily defended, as granted. For even according to
<hi>Horace</hi>'s ſtrict Rules, which were calculated for the laſt
Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Stage; tho'

               <p>If <hi>Horace</hi>'s Diſtinction is not taken for a full
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, becauſe it ſeems only to allow here and there ſome
Paſſionate and Great Strokes in a Comedy, and not a General Loftineſs of
the whole Pieces. Yet this too is very pardonable, when the Deſign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a ridiculous height of affected Eloquence and Stile. Thus, in the
<hi>Parliament of Women,</hi> while the Grave Matrons ſtrut in their
Husband's Cloathes, and ſeize the Adminiſtration of the State into their
Hands; 'tis fit they ſhould <hi>Talk,</hi> as well as <hi>Act</hi> and
<hi>Look</hi> like Senators.</p>
               <p>There is indeed one Part, throughout almoſt the whole Courſe
of <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi>'s Plays, which is written in a loftier Strain than
ordinary: but which too will<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99270:77"/>be excus'd as ſoon as nam'd.
Whoever underſtand's the Nature and Uſe of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> cannot be
offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it's <hi>Generous and Manly Part,</hi> is ſhown in Grave and
Elevated Verſe: And that the Poet does not exhort to Vertue, in the ſame
merry Stile which encounters Vice. To tell the <hi>Athenians</hi> in a direct
Addreſs, the Folly of ſome of their Counſels, and the Benefit of others:
to inſpire them with Heat and Vigour for a War: or to perſwade them

Bleſſings on the City; and to implore the future Protection of the Tutelar
Deities; were all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects too Noble for the Common Speech of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median. And
as long as the <hi>Chorus</hi> had ſometimes the ſame Employment in both
Species of the Drama, it could not be abſurd if it uſed too the ſame
Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in both.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s main Quarrel with
<hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> is his not being like <hi>Menander.</hi> And this is
as unjuſt a reaſon to condemn him; as if he ſhould have fallen foul on
his own <hi>Theſeus</hi> for not uſing the ſame Arms as <hi>Romulus,</hi>
or cenſur'd <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> for not fighting with the Conduct and the
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> For the Old Comedy as well as the
Old Method of War, was agreeable to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Age. And if the later
Improvements in both, ſhould be acknowledg'd to be founded on better and more
univerſal Reaſon: Yet we have not ſo much pretence to be angry with
thoſe ancient Maſters for neglecting them, as with Nature for not putting
them into their Heads.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi>'s Credit does not need ſo poor a
Plea, as the Rudeneſs of the Times to ſupport it. For tho' we ſhould
grant his Characters to be falſe, his Jokes Malicious or Obſcene; and his
Deſigns irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: Yet the Excellencies of his pure Stile will always keep
up his Name at a juſt height in the<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99270:77"/>World. He has been
long acknowledg'd on all hands for the happy Engroſſer of all the Charms,
and all the Delicacies of the Language he adorn'd; and for the Great
Treaſurer of the <hi>Attick</hi> Graces. And certainly we may be better
contented to ſcramble among ſome Dirt and Rubbiſh for all the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Beauties in <hi>Ariſtophanes;</hi> than to dig thro' much

               <p>AMong all the Complaints that have been made againſt the Old
Tribe of Grammarians and Commentators, there is not one with leſs injuſtice
taken up, than that which taxes them with their hard uſage of
<hi>Theocritus</hi>'s Story. For, as if it were impoſſible for them to
agree in their Verdict, tho' upon the plaineſt Evidence; we find them
ſtrangely<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99270:78"/>divided in their accounts of the Age and
Country of this Poet; when, all the while, he himſelf, if they would have
taken his Word, has ſettled both the Points beyond Diſpute.</p>
               <p>In an Epigram commonly ſet in the front of his Poem, and
perhaps according to the Author's Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Deſign, he thus acquaints us with
his City and Family.

                  <hi>Hiero,</hi> tho' a Prince who made a
great noiſe in the World by the Fortune of his Arms, and by the Fame of his
Good Government; yet ſeems to have expreſs'd no great Affection for
Letters. Which is ſuppos'd to have been the occaſion of
<hi>Theocritus</hi>'s Sixteenth <hi>Idyllium,</hi> inſcrib'd with
<hi>Hiero</hi>'s Name: where the Poet aſſerts the dignity of his own
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, complains of the poor encouragement it met with in the World;
and after a very Artiſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner, touching on ſome of the Nobleſt
Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Prince, ſhows what a Brave Figure he would have made in
Verſe, had he been as good a Patron, as he was an Argument, to the
Muſes.</p>
               <p>It's probable, this Unkindneſs of <hi>Hiero</hi> was the main
reaſon which prevail'd with <hi>Theocritus</hi> to leave <hi>Sicily</hi> for
the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Court; where King <hi>Ptolemy</hi> then ſat, Supreme
Preſident of Arts and Wit. And we may gueſs that the Poet met with kinder
Entertainment at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> than he had enjoy'd at
<hi>Syracuſe,</hi> from his famous Panegyrick on <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> which
makes his Seventeenth <hi>Idyllium;</hi> and in which, after the Praiſes of
his Race, his Power, and his Riches, he extols his Generous Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
Learning and Ingenuity, as ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the degree of common Virtues and
Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>There are no farther Memorials of the Poet's Life to be gather'd
from his Works, except his Friendſhip with <hi>Aratus</hi> the famous Author
of the <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> To <hi>Him</hi> he addreſſes his Sixth

Executed, by order of King <hi>Antigonus:</hi> and the reaſon of his
Misfortune was his moſt unſeaſonable Wit. For having committed a very
high Crime againſt that Prince, (who, by the way, had but one Eye) and
<hi>He</hi> promiſing him a Pardon, provided he would come into his
Preſence to accept it; his Friends were very urgent in haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his
Journey to Court, and told him he need not queſtion having his Life ſav'd,
as ſoon as ever he ſhould appear to his Majeſtie's Eyes: 
<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Nay then,</hi> (cried <hi>Theocritus</hi>)
<hi>I am a Dead Man, if that be the only Condition of my Pardon.</hi>
                  </q> And
this coming to <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Ear, He juſtly eſteem'd the Railery an
addition to the former Treaſon, and accordingly order'd Juſtice to
proceed.</p>
               <p>It cannot fairly be omitted, that the attributing the Fate of
<hi>Theocritus</hi> the Rhetorician to <hi>Theocritus</hi> the Poet, was an
eaſier ſlip, in as much as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer alſo pretended to ſome knack in
Verſe, and has an Epigram or two preſerv'd in <hi>Laertius</hi> and
<hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:99270:80"/>Tho' <hi>Theocritus</hi> paſſes in
common Eſteem, for no more than a Paſtoral Poet; yet he is manifeſtly
robb'd of great part of his Fame, if his other Peices have not their proper
Laurels. For (not to ſpeak of the few little Epigrams) as the larger ſhare
of his <hi>Idylliums,</hi> cannot properly be call'd the Songs of Shepherds,
ſo they are in too great repute, to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from the Character of
their Author.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time he ought, no doubt to lay his Paſtorals, as
the Foundation of his Credit. And upon the Claim he will be admitted for the
happy Finiſher, as well as for the Inventor of his Art; and will be
acknowledg'd to have excell'd all his following Rivals, as much as Originals
uſually do their Copies. He has the ſame advantage in the Rural, as
<hi>Homer</hi> had in the Epick Poeſy; and that was, to make the Criticks
turn <hi>His</hi> Practice into Eternal Rules, and to meaſure Nature
Herſelf by his accompliſh'd Model. And therefore, as to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate the
Glories of Heroick Numbers is the ſame thing, as to caſt up the Summ of
<hi>Homer</hi>'s Praiſes; ſo to ſet down all the Beauties of Paſtoral
Verſe, is no more than an indirect way of making ſo many ſhort
Panegyricks on <hi>Theocritus.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Theocritus</hi> has been ſo
much happier than <hi>Homer,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Eclogues are reckon'd
more unequal Imitations than his <hi>Aeneis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be own'd that the Dialect which <hi>Theocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
wrote in, has a great ſhare in his Honours. The old <hi>Dorian</hi> Phraſe
ſeems to have been introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c'd on purpoſe for theſe Compoſitions: Or
one would think this was the plain Language of the Golden Age; and that the
Poet had expreſs'd the Speech of theſe Good Mortals, as well as the
Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. On the other hand, many excellent Judges have maintain'd, that his
Muſe now and then, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99270:80"/>ſhow's her ill-breeding than
her ſimplicity: that her Country Air and Tone are both a little uncouth; at
leaſt that they appear ſo to the elegancy and the niceneſs of Modern
Times. Now to this Cenſure it might, with ſubmiſſion, be return'd; that
unleſs the Shepherds are allow'd ſome ruder liberties in their Words and
Carriage, they will ſeem to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg'd of the Privileges of their Nature
and their Condition. For tho' they ought not to be either groſsly ſtupid,
or critically refin'd; yet it would be a ſafer error to let them ſmell rank
of the Field, than to deck them with the leaſt ſpruceneſs of the City. We
ſee the ill effects of the contrary practiſe, in the famous Paſtorals of
the <hi>Italians</hi> and of the <hi>French;</hi> who have turn'd their Swains
into Courtiers, for fear of making them Clowns.</p>
               <p>It ſeems indeed, reaſonable enough, that the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of
Modern Tongues ſhould not admit the uſe of a groſſer Dialect, even in
Paſtoral Pieces: Tho', as for our ſelves, the <hi>Scotch-Songs</hi> which
paſs with ſo much applauſe, ſhow that it is not impoſſible to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive this old Conduct among Us with Succeſs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Theocritus</hi>
is not to be judg'd by the Manners of our Times, but by his own. We muſt not
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Performers in <hi>His</hi> Paſtorals like thoſe in
<hi>Spencer</hi>'s 
<q> 
                     <l>
                        <hi>Feeding their Flocks upon the Hills of
<hi>Kent,</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </l>
                  </q> But in the rude Fields of Ancient <hi>Sicily:</hi>
and <hi>here</hi> they may be as ruſtick as they pleaſe, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
tho' <hi>there</hi> perhaps they ought to have been more cautious and more
decent.</p>
               <p>It's certain <hi>Quintilian,</hi> however he has been of late
miſconſtrued, never intended his Judgment on <hi>Theocritus</hi> for a
Reproach, when he obſerves, that<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99270:81"/>

Rhetorician could mean no more, but that the Language and the thoughts of
<hi>Theocritus</hi>'s Shepherds ought neither to be imitated in Publick
ſpeaking, nor in any Gallant Compoſure. Yet the Poet might for all this, be
<hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in his way,</hi> as indeed, <hi>Quintilian</hi> in the ſame

               <p>But ſhould the Dialect of <hi>Theocritus</hi> not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among his Graces, he can produce enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to ſecure his Rural Crown
from the boldeſt Competitor. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> acknowledges him to have
been rais'd above <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf, by the inimitable tenderneſs of
his Paſſions; by the propriety of his Wit, never departing from the Plains
and Cottages; and by an Art that he has of betraying his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; (as his

Excellencies Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>

no breach of modeſty to affirm, that the greateſt part of the ſucceeding
Paſtorals, are as far diſtant from theſe Ornaments, as from the Age that
produc'd them for their Patterns. The Perſons introduc'd have not only the
Speech, but the Addreſs and the Carriage of Gentlemen: Their Love is the
higheſt Gallantry, and their Wit the choiceſt Invention. Our own

expreſs their form, yet they may fall under ſuch as will diſtinguiſh
their Praiſes. For the Nine firſt, and the Eleventh being all that are
acknowledg'd true Paſtorals, there are abundance of others, which are
therefore only not Paſtorals, becauſe the Scene of Buſineſs does not
lie in the Plains and Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grounds, but in ſome other part of the
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; not among the Shepherds, but among their Neighbours as rude and
ſimple as themſelves: Such as the <hi>Reapers</hi> in the Tenth

<hi>Fiſhermen</hi> in the Twenty-firſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now theſe Pieces
have a right to moſt of the fine things that are uſually ſaid of the

and on <hi>The Death of Adonis,</hi> ſeem both to be written with the Spirit

by the ſtroke of an Arrow. We hear too, that he was a very Voluminous Author,
tho' only one of his Peices has arriv'd at our Age; that beſides his Critical
Eſſays in Proſe, He exercis'd himſelf with fair Succeſs in almoſt
all the Fields of Poeſy, from the loftineſs of Tragedy to the humble Spirit
of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram, <pb n="153" facs="tcp:99270:83"/>which lays claim to the honour of his
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. But theſe Notices are of little concern to one that is impatient
to be acquainted with his <hi>Raving Lady,</hi> and who will gladly let
<hi>Caſſandra</hi>'s Story make amends for the deficiency of
<hi>Lycro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>The common account of this unhappy Propheteſs informs us, that
ſhe was Daughter to King <hi>Priam</hi> of <hi>Troy,</hi> and that being
courted in no very Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way, either by <hi>Apollo,</hi> or as ſome
will have it, by his Prieſts, upon promiſe of the Gift of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if
ſhe complied; ſhe firſt got poſſeſſion of the Reward, and then
honeſtly denied the ſervice. But her baffled Suitor in revenge for the
Injury, found a way to turn his Grant into a Curſe. For, procuring it to be
order'd by the Voice of the Oracle, that no Man ſhould ever credit what
<hi>Caſſandra</hi> ſaid; her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration prov'd a deſperate torment
to her, inſtead of a Heavenly favour.</p>
               <p>This then is the foundation of <hi>Lycophrons</hi>'s Piece.
<hi>Caſſandra,</hi> or as ſhe was otherwiſe call'd, <hi>Alexandra,</hi>
is ſuppos'd to be ſhut up in a cloſe Tower, as well to keep her from
frighting the People; as to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Solitary Confinement might not
bring her to her right Senſes. During this reſtraint, her
ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Old Father commands the Keeper to come and bring him a
punctual Account of all that the Princeſs had ſaid under her Fit. This
Recital made by the Keeper, is the <hi>Form</hi> of the Poem. He begins with a
promiſe of Faithfulneſs, and, having hinted to the King, how different a
manner of Speech ſhe had now us'd from her common ſtrain, appearing a meer
<hi>Sphinx,</hi> and affecting the darkeſt and the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd thought
and expreſſion; he then proceeds to repeat her whole intricate Speech to
the King. In which, beginning at the Voyage of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was then
Sail'd for <hi>Sparta</hi> on his amorous Expedition;<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99270:84"/>She
throws out in a moſt terrible Rant, a predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the Miſeries that
ſhould be occaſion'd by this Adventure: The Calamities of the ten Years
Seige of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the no leſs ſtrange Diſaſters, that
ſhould happen, as well to the returning Victors, as to the diſpers'd
Relicks of the Conquer'd People. At laſt ſhe enquires into the Original
Cauſe of the Quarrel between <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> and, having
deſcrib'd the ſtealing away of <hi>Europa,</hi> the Voyage of the
<hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nautes,</hi> and the other famous Old Contentions; ſhe looks forward
to the Deſign of <hi>Xerxes</hi> againſt <hi>Greece;</hi> and having
reach'd the Times ſucceeding <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, ſhe there breaks
off, upon a ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance that no Body will, at preſent, believe Her.
And then the Keeper with a ſhort Epilogue to the King, concludes the Poem:
which is a kind of Tragick <hi>Monody,</hi> or Narrative of a ſingle
Perſon.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are not ſo equal Judges as to diſtinguiſh
between the Deſign and the Execution, will be ſure to condemn a Poet,
whoſe chief Ends are Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Delight, for uſing ſuch a
Conduct, as by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring him wilfully unintelligible, muſt needs make him
appear very unpleaſant. But whoever can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>Lycophron</hi> for the
raſhneſs of his Undertaking, cannot fail to applaud him for the
greateneſs of his Succeſs. If it be reckon'd ſo glorious in a Modern
Tragedian to hit the ſhort Character of a <hi>raving Perſon,</hi> and to
ſuit the Language to the extravagancy of the Condition: what an Atchievment
was it, to fill a whole Piece with the ſingle Repreſentation of a
Poſſeſſed Lady, and yet never to tranſgreſs againſt nature and
decency? In drawing the Image of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Madneſs, 'tis enough to be
<hi>handſomly abſurd.</hi> But when the Frenzy is ſuppos'd to be Divine,

could better anſwer ſuch a Project, than to join in one wild Diſcourſe,

               <p>But the greateſt teſtimonies of <hi>Callimachus</hi>'s
worth, and the foundation of his Character with the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, were his
numerous Pieces in the Elegiac Strain, Of theſe, we have only the Hymn on
<hi>Minerva</hi>'s Bath, and <hi>Catullus</hi>'s Tranſlation of the Copy, on
Queen <hi>Berenice</hi>'s Hair. The former ſeems, like his other Hymns, to
incline moſt to the free Spirit of Lyriques; the curious Story of
<hi>Tireſias</hi> making the greater part of the Poem. The other is more
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Common Notions of Elegy; and, as it is commonly printed with
the Works of <hi>Tibullus</hi> and <hi>Propertius</hi> in the ſame Strain;
ſo it may vie with the ſweeteſt and the moſt exact of their Pieces. For
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99270:88"/>inſtance, they have nothing of a more natural turn, than
that thought which makes it a greater Honour to belong to the Queen's Head,

               <p>
                  <hi>APOLLONIUS</hi> was an <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Hilleus</hi> or <hi>Silleus;</hi> as we learn from <hi>Suidas,</hi> and
from the old Scholiaſts; and theſe are the chief Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities that can be
expected for the Stories of thoſe Poets, whom we reckon ſo far inferior to
the reſt in Age and in Wit.</p>
               <p>He ſtudied under the Care of <hi>Callimachus,</hi> but prov'd
a very ungrateful Scholar to that Great Man. Which reproach, together with the
Revenge it brought upon him, has been hinted in his Maſter's Life. By this,
we cannot doubt, but that he was Born under <hi>Ptolemy Philadelphus,</hi> and
made his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the World, in the Reign of the Succeeding Prince,
<hi>Ptolemy Euergetes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He compos'd his firſt Eſſay of the <hi>Argonauticks,</hi>
in the raſh heat of his Youth; and, reading the Piece in publick, came off
with very poor ſucceſs. The ſhame of this Diſappointment, mortified him
to ſuch a degree, that he left his Country, and retir'd to <hi>Rhodes.</hi>
Here, reſolving to fix a conſiderable time, and ſetting up for a
Profeſſor of Rhetorick, he ſoon found his Name chang'd from
<hi>Apollonius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to <hi>Apollonius</hi> of
<hi>Rhodian;</hi> which has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd ever ſince, to the injury of his
Native City.</p>
               <p>As the chief deſign of his willful Baniſhment was to
retrieve his Credit, by poliſhing his Work; ſo he plied the Project ſo
hard at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that having compleated the Corrections and
Improvements, and trying his Fortune once more in a Publick Recitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he
gave a general ſatisfaction to the People, and had the Honour to be made free
Denizen of their<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99270:90"/>City. And then returning to
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing his Poem, he was receiv'd with
univerſal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and merited the Reward of ſucceeding
<hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> in the care of the famous Library.</p>
               <p>We hear no more of him, but, (what is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary) that
they buried him in the ſame Tomb with his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>aſter <hi>Callimachus.</hi>
Either to make a feign'd Reconcilement after Death between Perſons that could
not brook any while they were living: Or to put a fair covering on the Quarrel,
and to hide it from the knowledge of Poſterity.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Subject of <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s Poem, be one of the
Nobleſt and moſt celebrated Actions of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the Expedition in
ſearch of the GOLDEN FLEECE, yet he has ſcarce the happineſs to be rank'd
with the Old Maſters of Epick Verſe. One great reaſon of his
diſappointment, muſt needs be the advantage <hi>Ovid</hi> has had of him,
in touching on the ſame Adventure: All Perſons being more inclin'd to hear
an imperfect Relation from a Gentleman, than to bear the tedious exactneſs of
a profeſs'd Scholar.</p>
               <p>But tho' in Contentions of the preſent Times the partiality of
the Judges be a fair Plea for a vanquiſh'd Rival, yet it will not hold in
Caſes that have been trying for many Ages together. A Thouſand Years once
paſt over, leave no more room for injuſtice, than they do for Envy: And
whoever is worſted in ſo long a Combat, muſt atribute the miſcarriage,
not to the Credit of his Antagoniſt, but to his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault. So that to
aſſign the reaſon, why the Poem of the <hi>Argonauticks</hi> is ſo
little in Mens Mouths, and ſo much leſs in their hands, we ſhould not run
to the Favour of <hi>Ovid,</hi> but to the Failings of <hi>Apollonius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then <hi>Horace</hi>'s Rule be true, of 
<q> 
                     <l>

                  <hi>Apollonius</hi> has no hard
meaſure in being denied an honourable Place among the Poets, ſince the
ableſt Pleaders in his Defence, could never make him riſe above the middle
way. <hi>Quintilian</hi> tells us, he wrote <hi>aequali quâdam
mediocritate.</hi> And tho' <hi>Longin</hi> gives him the fair Title of
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet it's plain he can mean no
more, but that the Poet has fall'n into no groſs abſurdities, but kept an
even courſe of Writing. For whatever ſome may make of that Epithet, it
looks very Suſpicious that <hi>Longin</hi> deſign'd it for no great
Commendation; ſince he only brings in this Author, as an Example to confirm
the Maxim, he had juſt laid down, that a middle Stile without any faults, is
not ſo eligible as a loftineſs attended with many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>It's probable, that what the two Grand Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians thus
deliver as their opinion concerning <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> was intended to reach
no farther than his Thought and Style. But had it lain in ther way to ſpeak
of his Conduct and Contrivance, they would not, perhaps, have been more
favourable Judges. For they could never have diſcover'd in him, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
Arts of Inſtitution and Mechaniſm, which they would put into the
Deſinition of Epick Poeſy. And, as from the plain and unartificial courſe
of the Action, they muſt have eſteem'd him a very <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Poet;</hi> ſo, they could not but have reckon'd him a very <hi>Poetical
Hiſtorian</hi> too, from the liberty he has taken in meaſuring the time of
the Adventure.</p>
               <p>Thus until a <hi>Second Rate</hi> be admitted in Poetry,
<hi>Apollonius</hi> is not like to get a place in the Liſt.
<hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus</hi> will be ſomething like <hi>Siſyphus</hi>'s Mountain
to him: if his Muſe cannot lift him to the very Top, ſhe had as good never
have carried him up half-way; while the Criticks, not leſs ſevere than the
Infernal Judges, cruelly thruſt him down again, and force him out of her
Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:99270:91"/>Yet <hi>Apolloneus</hi>'s Friends can never
be driven to Deſpair, while their Poet is acknowledg'd to have ſet Patterns

<hi>Gonaras</hi> King of <hi>Macedon;</hi> who began his Reign in the Hundred

in the Hundred and fifth, as we find it corruptly in the Life of the Poet

               <p>The Old Scholiaſts when they compile <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Life
complain grieviouſly of a Story that was got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, how King
<hi>Antigonus,</hi> meerly for the Jeſts ſake, commanded <hi>Him</hi> to
write of Heavenly Bodies, and <hi>Nicander</hi> of the Art of Medecine; whereas
<hi>Nicander</hi> was an expert Aſtronomer, and <hi>Aratus</hi> a celebrated
Phyſician, but both of them entire Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99270:93"/>to one

as far from being Cotemporaries as Twelve, (they might have ſaid Twenty)
Olympiads could make them. The former living in the time of the firſt
<hi>Ptolemy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the other under the Fifth Prince
of that Name. But they never mention the occaſion of this Vulgar Error for
fear of injuring, in ſome meaſure, the Author they were to adorn.
Otherwiſe, they might have fix'd a Foundation for the Fancy in
<hi>Tully</hi>'s account of theſe Two Poets, given in his Firſt Book <hi>de
Oratore,</hi> where he tells us, 
<q rend="inline">"'Twas a confeſs'd Point among the Learned,
that <hi>Aratus,</hi> a Man utterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Aſtrology had written moſt

               <p>His Work, which in many Old Editions paſſes for no more than
a ſingle Poem with the common Name of
ΦΑΙΝΟΜΕΝΑ, has been thought ſince to
make two diſtinct Pieces, the firſt only being call'd
ΦΑΙΝΟΜΕΝΑ, and the Second Entitul'd
ΔΙΟΣΗΜΕΙΑ. The former is properly
Aſtronomical, giving an account of the Situation and the Affection, of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99270:93"/>Heavenly Bodies; the other Aſtrological, ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
particular Influences, ariſing from their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſpoſitions, and
relations. Yet whoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the Noble Beginning of the
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and the plain entrance on the <hi>Dioſem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ia</hi> without any Formality or
Addreſs; will ſtill conclude them to be one Poem divided into Two
Books.</p>
               <p>The late <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Criticks,
extremely deſpiſe this Performance: becauſe the Subject of it, according
to their Notions, is not properly Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Yet <hi>Cicero</hi> could tell us
that <hi>Arate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> compos'd
<hi>Ornatiſſimos atque optimos verſus, moſt Polite, and moſt
Excellent Verſes:</hi> Yet <hi>Quintilian</hi> could declare, 
<q rend="inline">"that tho' the Matter of his Work want's Motion,
having no Variety, no Paſſions, no Perſon that ever makes a Speech; yet
he has fully anſwer'd his Argument, which was all that he propos'd."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, as the Honours done the Poet by the favours of King
<hi>Antigonus,</hi> by the Labour of no leſs than Forty <hi>Greek</hi>
Scholiaſts, and above all by the Verſions and Illuſtrations of
<hi>Germanìcus Caeſar,</hi> and of <hi>Tully;</hi> are ſufficient
Proofs what a Value An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity ſet upon his Compoſitions: So he is not
altogether to ſeek in what may recommend him as forcibly to Modern Taſts,
and to a new Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For tho' the Doctrine of the Stars Dominion in
Heaven, be almoſt as much out of faſhion, as the Stories how they came
thither; and tho' few will be at the pains to read on a Subject which they
eſteem but cramp Nonſence; yet <hi>Aratus</hi> has in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
provided againſt that Misfortune, by introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Work, with ſuch a
Strain of Sence, of Wit, and of <hi>Religion;</hi> as if it does not charm Men
to look quite thro' the Poem, yet will engage them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that firſt
Eſſay the Praiſe of an entire Labour. It cannot be amiſs to ſet it
down in this place; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99270:94"/>few Readers go any farther,
and all ought to go thus far.

                  <hi>NIcander</hi> was a <hi>Colophonian,</hi> as not only
<hi>Suidas,</hi> but <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Macrobius</hi> call him. Therefore
<hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naquil Faber</hi> had no reaſon to paſs ſuch a hard cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on
<hi>Suidas</hi> for not making him a Native of <hi>Claros.</hi> It's true he
calls himſelf a <hi>Clarian</hi> at the end of one of his Pieces now extant,
and at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the other. But 'twas uſual with the Men of
<hi>Colophon</hi> to borrow an Epithet from their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring City, which the
Temple of <hi>Apollo Clarius</hi> made ſo renown'd in the World: as may
hereafter be obſerv'd in the Story of <hi>Antimachus,</hi> concerning whom,
the <hi>French</hi> Critick has publiſh'd the ſame miſtake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicander</hi> liv'd in the time of <hi>Attalus</hi> the
laſt King of <hi>Pergamus;</hi> who left the <hi>Roman</hi> People Heirs to
his Kingdom: that is, about the 160th Olympiad. He was famous for the triple
Profeſſion of Phyſick Grammar and Poeſie: and has a vaſt number of
Pieces in Proſe and Verſe, attributed to him in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authors, which are
reckon'd up by <hi>Voſſius</hi> in his Fourth Book <hi>de Hiſtoricis
Graecis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all probability the Muſes had the leaſt ſhare in his
Fame. For tho' <hi>Cicero</hi> indeed commends his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> as a
Work of a very happy Vein, yet in his common Character, his Learning runs much
higher than his Wit. The two ſurviving Poems of the <hi>Theriaca</hi> and the
<hi>Alexipharmaca,</hi> (both ſpent in the ſame general Subject of
providing againſt the miſchiefs of poyſonous Creatures, tho' by different
Medecines) are manifeſtly intended more for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction 
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99270:96"/>than Delight; more for the aſſiſtance of the Memory,
than the entertainment of the Fancy or of the Ear. So that he would moſt
infallibly loſe his place among the Ancient Poets, if his pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were
not ſupported by a juſter Credit, obtain'd on other accounts: every Tribe
being deſirous of admitting a Great Man into their Profeſſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making much enquiry whether or no he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the particular Buſineſs
of their Art.</p>

to a Perſon who had ſo much oblig'd him, and whom he profeſſes to
follow above all Men in the Geographical Part of his Work. He tells us then, 
<q rend="inline">"That <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was a Native of this

and will have that to be underſtood of thoſe later Emperors, who had
commonly Aſſociates in the Supreme Power. But, beſides that this might be
as well ſpoken in either of thoſe junctures when <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
ſhar'd the Soveraignty with <hi>Antony,</hi> or with <hi>Tiberius;</hi> it
does not much advance the Credit of theſe Learned Men, either not to have met

                  <hi>Dionyſius</hi> wrote a great number of Pieces, reckon'd up

that this one of the moſt exact Syſtems of Ancient Geography, when it has

               <p>'Tis a common Fancy, that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> is no more to be

               <p>
                  <hi>OPPIAN</hi> was Born at <hi>Anazarbus</hi> a City of
<hi>Cili</hi>-according to moſt of the Ancient accounts of his Life. For

<hi>Corycians;</hi> tho' not ſo clearly, but that at firſt Glance it might
give ſome colour to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
               <p>The time of his Birth, is as unſettl'd, as we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſind ſuch matters. But it's certain that <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and
<hi>Euſebius</hi> are vaſtly out, when they place it under <hi>Marcus
Antoninus.</hi> For ſuppoſing him to have died at thirty Years old, as is
conſtantly reported; how could he, according to this account, have
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his <hi>Cynegeticks</hi> to <hi>Antoninus Caracalla;</hi> tho' the
very beginning ſhows them to have been thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd? For all know that
there paſs'd above Thirty Years between thoſe Emperors. And yet the moſt
Learned Editor of his Works <hi>Ritterhuſius</hi> has made as great a ſlip
on the other hand, by fixing his Birth in the Reign of <hi>Severus.</hi> For,
<hi>that</hi> taking in only the Compaſs of Eighteen Years; it is very
unlikely he ſhould at ſuch an Age finiſh and preſent his
<hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euticks,</hi> as (we are certain he did) in the Life time of that
Emperor. The middle way then, muſt be to<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99270:99"/>ſuppoſe he
might be born in the former part of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi>'s Reign; which cannot be
charg'd with the like abſurdities as the other Opinions.</p>
               <p>His Father <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> is recorded to have been eminent
for his Learning and Wiſdom, and no leſs remarkable for his Riches and
Authority in the City. So that <hi>Oppian</hi> had perhaps a greater advantage
than any of his Predeceſſors, for the poliſhing himſelf with all the
Arts and Accompliſhments of Human Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>He had ſcarce finiſh'd the entire courſe of his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
when an unhappy accident diverted them for the preſent, to make them
afterwards the more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious. The Emperor <hi>Severus,</hi> taking a
Progreſs thro' <hi>Cilicia,</hi> honour'd <hi>Anazarbus,</hi> among other
Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with a Viſit. Now at the Proceſſion that was made to receive him,
the Magiſtrates waiting on him in their Formalities; Old
<hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> as a greater Philoſopher than a Courtier, was the only
Man miſſing at the Solemnity. This peice of diſreſpect the Emperor
reſented ſo highly, as to baniſh the old Gentleman into the Iſland
<hi>Malta;</hi> whither his Son likewiſe went, the voluntary Companion of his
Troubles.</p>
               <p>But <hi>He,</hi> with a Fate not uncommon to the Men of his
Profeſſion, ow'd his Glory to his Misfortunes. For endeavouring, under this
ſad Confinement to amuze himſelf and his Father with the diverſions of
Poetry: He began, after ſome fortunate attempts in that way, to conceive
hopes of allaying the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Diſpleaſure by the ſame means as had
leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd the Effects of it. To this purpoſe he engag'd in the
<hi>Halieuticks,</hi> dedicated to that Emperor's Son, the deſign of which
Work he thus gives us himſelf at the entrance on it.

               </p>
               <p>From the <hi>Greek</hi> accounts of his Life, commonly prefix'd
to his Works, 'tis impoſſible to determine, whether he took his Journey to
Court preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the finiſhing of his <hi>Halieuticks;</hi> or
whether his Verſes of <hi>Hunting,</hi> and perhaps other pieces were not
offer'd at the ſame time: tho' they Generally ſeem more inclin'd to favour
the laſt Conjecture. Yet if we conſider what <hi>Sozomen</hi> the
Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian has obſerv'd, that <hi>Severus</hi> was alive
when the firſt Preſent was made to his Son <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and did
himſelf order the Reward: and withal, that in<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99270:100"/>the Poem
of <hi>Fiſhing, Oppian</hi> compliments both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son as then reigning
with joint Power; and that in the Poem of Hunting the ſame Addreſs is not
us'd: we might conclude with ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that the former Work only was
offer'd to <hi>Antoninus</hi> during his Father's Life; and the other when he
was left in ſole poſſeſſion of the Empire.</p>
               <p>But then, if we venture a ſecond Reflection, and lay before us
the conſtant tradition of the Author's dying ſoon after his Journey to
Court, and never find any more Journies mention'd than one; we muſt be forc'd
in ſome meaſure to recede from this deciſion; and to believe that the
<hi>Cynegeticks</hi> were never preſented with the Poets own hands.</p>
               <p>However this matter is to be ſetled, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his
Journey comes generally atteſted and agreed on. That the Emperour, being
raviſh'd with the Beauty and Art of his Compoſitions, in the firſt place
order'd him a Piece of Gold for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Verſe; and then promis'd him the Grant
of any farther Favour he ſhould demand. This laſt Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs furniſh'd
him with an opportunity of recalling his Father from Baniſhment; and was
piouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to that good Purpoſe. But he did not live long to enjoy
the Bleſſing he had reſtor'd. For a fatal Peſtilence at
<hi>Anazarbus</hi> ſwept him away among the Multitude, ſoon after his
return, and quiet ſettltment there: he having reach'd no more than the
Thirtieth Year of his Age. He was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd with the higheſt Honours; and had
a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Statue erected to his Memory, with this Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

and the <hi>Halieuticks,</hi> of <hi>Hunting</hi> and <hi>Fiſhing;</hi> the
Third which he is ſaid to have compos'd on the Art of Fowling, being yet
vainly expected from the <hi>Italian</hi> Libraries, where it was long ſince
thought to be buried.</p>
               <p>The <hi>drineſs</hi> of his Subjects, tho' it offends ſome
Modern <hi>French</hi> Criticks, yet has not hindred him from being eſteem'd
by more knowing Judges, as an Author little Inferior in Fancy, Art and
Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to the moſt celebrated Maſters in the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Strain.
His vaſt numbers of alluſions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, as they would have
ſhown his Wit in any Deſign; ſo they give an equal proof of his
Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too, while they are appli'd to Themes that ſtood ſo much in need
of thoſe Ornaments. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the ending ſtrokes of each Poem have
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſo great a Spirit and Turn, as ſhow him to have had a
Genius for much more Heroical At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivements in Verſe. The firſt Lines of
the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuticks</hi> having been already ſet down, it will not be
improper to add the two other Addreſſes to the Emperor, at the Entrance of
the other Poem, and at the Concluſion of that.

               <p>The Manner of his Death is more talk'd of, and generally laid to
the Charge of the <hi>Thracian</hi> Dames. They ſay, that the Womens Quarrel

Urn on the top, ſaid to contain the Bones of the Poet. The River
<hi>Helicon</hi> juſt by this place was obſerv'd to fall under Ground, and
to riſe again at a conſiderable diſtance. The Tradition of the People
thereabouts, was, that anciently the River run all along with an open Current;
but that, when the cruel Dames would have waſh'd off <hi>Orpheus</hi>'s Blood
in its Stream; it immediately ſuppreſs'd it's Waters, leaſt they ſhould
contribute to the expiation of ſo horrid a Crime. There are two other
accounts of<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99270:108"/>his Death. The Firſt makes him to have
periſh'd by a Thunder-bolt, for daring to diſcloſe ſome My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries to
Mankind, which Heaven intended to keep them unacquainted with. The other
reports, that after the Death of his Wife, coming to <hi>Aornus</hi> in

<hi>Euridice</hi> to be always behind him at his Heels; he at laſt ventur'd

               <p>Whatever Works he might leave behind him, it was concluded as

               <p>HE was born at <hi>Miletus;</hi> but liv'd at <hi>Athens,</hi>
maintaining himſelf by his Elegiac Muſe, his Pipe, and his School. His
ſtory is one of the fineſt of Antiquity; and the Glorious ſucceſs of
his Verſes has advanc'd his Name to the Rank of the Greateſt Heroes as well
as of the Nobleſt Poets.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> having block'd up
<hi>Meſſene</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted City of <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> many Years;
and having ſworn to carry the Town or to die all before it: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conſulting the <hi>Pythian</hi> Oracle were advis'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and to borrow of them a General, who ſhould
infallibly put a happy concluſion to the Siege. The <hi>Athenians</hi> to be
ſure were not much inclin'd to aſſiſt ſuch powerful Neighbours.
However to ſhow ſome kind of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Oracle, and ſome Sence of
the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done to their City; they ſent them <hi>Tyrtaeus,</hi> and did not
much envy the Glory they were likely to get, under ſuch a ridiculous
Commander. For, beſides his poor Employment of teaching Boys; he is reported
to have been ſhort, and very deform'd; blind of one Eye, and lame into the
Bargain: and paſſing for little better than a Fool in the Opinion of his
Neighbours. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were, however, very glad to receive
him, deſiring no other Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but his being lent them by the
<hi>Athenians.</hi> With him in their Train they advanc'd with the greateſt
Hopes toward <hi>Meſſene;</hi> and talk'd of nothing but of the Victory
which was to attend this Meſſenger of the Fates. But being unfortunately
defeated in three ſeveral Engagements; they grew ſo deſperate as to enrol
the very Slaves whom they mortally abhorr'd,<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99270:110"/>in the Liſt
of Soldiers; and to promiſe them the Wives of thoſe Citizens who died in
the War. And when this laſt ignoble ſhift prov'd ineffectual, the
<hi>Spartan</hi> Kings were reſolv'd to lead back the Relicks of their Army;
and to conſult at home about ſome better meaning of the Oracle's Advice. To
hinder this fatal Deſign, <hi>Tyrtaeus</hi> began to exert all his Spirit,
and all his Inſinuation: And at laſt by his continual Lectures of Honour
and Courage, deliver'd in mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſe to the Army; he raviſh'd them to
ſuch a Degree with the thoughts of dying for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that being all
bent on another Attack, and at the ſame time, as it were, ſure of falling
in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter: every Soldier bound a little Plate of Braſs about his Arm,
with an Inſcription giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Name and Family; for the uſe
of thoſe who ſhould have the Care of their Interment. And now, ruſhing on
with a furious Tranſport to meet the Enemy, who came out of the City on the
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiance ſent them; after a moſt Bloody Field, the Victory fell to the
<hi>Lacedaemonians:</hi> and the Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were oblig'd to be ſatisfied with

other hand, finding all eaſier Methods inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, determin'd to recover
their Poet's Body at the Expence of a War. But it's probable they might be
diverted from this Deſign by the Advice of their Maſter <hi>Phalaris,</hi>
whom they conſulted on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and deſir'd his Aſſiſtance.
He tells them in his Anſwer<note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Epiſt.
54.</bibl>
                  </note>, that he was ready to undertake any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treprize for the
ſake of <hi>Steſichorus;</hi> even to proclaim War againſt the Fates
themſelves for his Deliverance. But then, he would have them conſider, that
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Divine Poet was Buried, he would ſtill be reckon'd an
<hi>Himerian:</hi> and ſtill belong to their City, on account of his Birth
and Life; tho' all other places in the World ſhould claim him for his Virtue.
That, ſeeing how dangerous it might prove to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with ſo good
Neighbours, they ſhould venture to let the <hi>Catanians</hi> build him a
Sepulchre; while they themſelves erected a Temple to his Memory, and fix'd up
his Verſes in all the Publick Places of the City: Never counting their Friend
dead, whileſt<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99270:115"/>any of theſe Monuments remain'd. In
ſhort, that, they ſhould conſider, it would be always a greater Honour to
their City, to have bred a Perſon of ſuch a Character, than to the Perſon
himſelf, to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it.</p>
               <p>But this was not the only Honour the Tyrant paid to the Memory
of <hi>Steſichorus;</hi> for we have ſtill the Conſolatory Epiſtle<note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Epiſt. 103.</bibl>
                  </note> which he wrote to the
Poet's Children; where, beſides his Art of allaying their Grief, he has given
ſo Noble a Teſtimony of the Father's Worth; as is enough to make us form
much kinder Notions of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> than we draw from common
Hiſtory.</p>
               <q> When he happen'd (ſays he) to fall under my Power and
Threats, he never diſcover'd the leaſt fear of what he expected to
ſuffer; but prov'd as Generous a Captive, as he had been an Enemy. His
Wiſdom broke the force of my Tyranny; and 'twas impoſſible for me to do
him any Miſchief, becauſe whatever I did, he ſtill turn'd into a
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſit. When by infinite Labours I had at laſt gain'd him to Me; or
rather made my ſelf his Captive; all that I ever deſir'd was to make him
ſome return for the Favour. Therefore I don't reckon, you ought to thank me,
if theſe laſt twelve Years of his Life, I have paid him a conſtant
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; but that I rather am ſtill infinitely in his Debt; who beſides
his kindneſs of ſtrengthening my Mind in other matters, was the only Man in
the World, who had the Power of perſwading me to deſpiſe Death.</q>
               <p>If theſe Epiſtles of <hi>Phalaris</hi> are not acknowledg'd
for Genuine; (as they lie under heavy ſuſpicions) tho' we loſe a great
part of the true Hiſtory of the Poet's Life; yet we ſtill advance the main
point, the<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99270:116"/>Eſteem and the Character he bore with
Antiquity. However we may venture to borrow one more No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from the ſame
Memoires; And that is, that his Daughters inherited ſome part of his Spirit
and his Vein. The Tyrant tells one of his Friends<note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Epiſt. 67.</bibl>
                  </note> that having been at
<hi>Himera</hi> on Buſineſs, he happen'd to hear <hi>Steſichorus</hi>'s
Daughters ſinging to the Harp, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Fathers, and partly their own
Compoſitions; which tho' not equal to his, yet were preferable to all others
in the World.</p>
               <p>We have no Catalogue of his Works on Record: <hi>Suidas</hi>
only tells us in general that he compos'd 26 Books of <hi>Lyrics</hi> in the
<hi>Dorian</hi> Dialect: Of which, [a few ſcraps, not amounting to
threeſcore Lines, are ſet together in the Collection of <hi>Fulvius
Urſinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Majeſty and Greatneſs make the Common Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his
Stile. Hence <hi>Horace</hi> gives him the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves Camaenae.</hi> Hence
<hi>Alexander,</hi> in <hi>Dion Chryſoſtom,</hi> reckons him among the
Poets whom a Prince ought to read: And <hi>Syneſius</hi> puts him and
<hi>Homer</hi> together as the Noble Celebrators of the Heroick Race.
<hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilians</hi>'s Judgment on this Works will juſtifie all this. 
<q rend="inline">"The force (ſays he) of <hi>STESICHORUS</hi>'s

He had Compos'd a Panegyrick on one of the Victors in the Games, and was
reading it in the Gentleman's Houſe, before a numerous Auditory. But
happening after the uſual manner of Poetical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, to ſpend a
great part of the Poem in the Praiſes of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and
<hi>Pollux;</hi> his Chapman refus'd to give him above one half of the Price,
and told him he might look for the other half from the Deities that he had
celebrated. Preſently after News was brought in, that two Young Gentlemen on
White Horſes, were at the Gate, deſiring to ſpeak with the Poet.
<hi>Simonides</hi> going out, found no Gentlemen, but ſoon found their
Reward. For he was but juſt over the Threſhold, when the Houſe fell down,
and daſh'd the whole Company, ſo miſerably to pieces, that when their

               <p>Whatever Character <hi>Theognis</hi> bears on the account of
reſcuing Poeſy from light and uſeleſs Subjects, to employ it in the
ſervice of Virtue and Goodneſs: Yet we find <hi>Athenaeus</hi> reckoning
him among the moſt extravagant Voluptuaries; and citing ſome of his
Verſes, as a ſufficient juſtification of the Cenſure. And indeed
<hi>Suidas</hi> in the Account of his Works, takes notice of a Piece Entitul'd
<hi>Exhortations</hi> or <hi>Admonitions;</hi> which he ſays, was ſtain'd
with the mixture of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Love, and other things, very different from the
Principles of Honeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:99270:129"/>Yet the Moral Work which we have of his at
preſent, in an Elegy of above a Thouſand Verſes, muſt be acknowledg'd
for an uſeful Summary of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and Reflections; and is clear from the
Charge of Looſneſs and Debauchery. Tho' perhaps it might not be left in
this good Condition by the. Author; but when it came abroad in the World, the
lewd and groſs Notions may have been taken out, to fit it for a true uſe;
and the void ſpaces fill'd up with ſome graver Sentences, deliver'd by
other Wife-men of thoſe Times, in the ſame kind of Verſe.</p>
               <p>We muſt not expect in theſe Compoſitions, the Genius and
the Fire of Poetry. On the contrary, things are here told for the moſt part
in the ſimpleſt manner; without the leaſt advantage of Ornament or
Diſguize. And, as we know they were chiefly employ'd in the Inſtruction of
Children; ſo one would imagine the Leſſons to have been put into
<hi>Verſe</hi> more for the aſſiſtance of the Reader's Memory, than the
Pleaſure of his Wit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phocylides,</hi> as he has ſcarce any Fragments
remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo is little talk'd of in Hiſtory; except that he is now and
then honour'd with the general Praiſe of being one of the beſt
<hi>Maſters</hi> of the <hi>Grecian Sentences. Suidas</hi> tells us, he was
born at <hi>Miletus</hi> in <hi>Ionia;</hi> that he wrote Heroick Verſes and
Elegies, and that his <hi>Admonitions</hi> or Moral Precepts were ſtol'n from
the Writings of the <hi>Sibyls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have ſtill a Moral Piece in long Verſe among the Minor
Poets, which goes under the Name of <hi>Phocylides.</hi> But it will appear on
the firſt glance to have been the Work or ſome Primitive Chriſtian; from
the many paſſages borrow'd from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, and from the
noble Deſcription of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Some indeed are unwilling to allow
his Title to the Chriſtian Faith, from his way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf
in this laſt point.

whereas it had been ſaid under the Story of <hi>Plato,</hi> that the

bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing from the Phyſiological Commentaries which <hi>Laertius</hi> ſets
among <hi>Epycharmus</hi>'s Works.</p>
               <p>He died aged 90 Years, according to <hi>Laertius;</hi> or 97 as
<hi>Lucian</hi> has him among his Long-livers. <hi>Laertius</hi> has
preſerv'd theſe Verſes, which were the Inſcription of one of his

Gentleman; but running away and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelf to <hi>Herodotus</hi> the
Hiſtorian, he grew in Love with the Study of Eloquence. He is reported too to

Victory which the <hi>Athenians</hi> gain'd over <hi>Xerxes,</hi> now entirely

make the Faith of <hi>Horace,</hi> and the Honour of <hi>Alexander</hi> agree
together, in relation to this Story. But they bring off the Prince's Judgment
with a couple of Fetches. Firſt they tell us, that the Bargain he made with
<hi>Choerilus,</hi> was to give him a piece of Gold for every good Verſe, and
a box on the Ear for every bad one. And then they relate it as one of his

they might mean no more than this Allegorical Sence, that they were entire
Maſters of the Ridicule, and refin'd Buffoonry. In the ſame manner, as when
they report, that <hi>Democritus</hi> did nothing but Laugh, and
<hi>Heraclitus</hi> on the other hand was always in tears: they might deſign
no more, than to let us underſtand, that the firſt of theſe
Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99270:143"/>having a full and ſenſible knowledge
of the Vanity of all Human things, eſteem'd them only as the Toys of
Children, and the Sport of Wiſe Men. While <hi>Heraclitus</hi> took the
matter more to heart, and thought the moſt ordinary accidents of Life
deſerv'd a ſerious pity: and that the Perſons concern'd in them, were to
be brought to a right ſence, by a moſt ſober Application, and the Arts of
a ſtudied condolement.</p>
               <p>But we have two larger Accounts of his Death; from
<hi>Suidas</hi> and <hi>Apuleius,</hi> which as they don't much prejudice one
another, ſo they are not utterly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable to this firſt Notion:
Since they inſiſt only on Circumſtances that attended his Death, without
expreſſing the immediate occaſion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suidas</hi> his Story is to this purpoſe. When the
<hi>Athenians</hi> were engag'd in a War with <hi>Antigonus; Philemon</hi>
living in the <hi>Piraeus,</hi> ſaw in his Dream Nine Virgins going out of
the Houſe: he fancied that he ask'd them what their Deſign was; and for
what reaſon they were ſo unkind to leave him; and thought they made
Anſwer, they were going to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, it not being lawful that he
ſhould hear them any longer. The Poet waking from his Dream told the Boy that
ſat by him, the whole Buſineſs. And afterwards falling to Work on
finiſhing the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that he was then about, he wrap'd himſelf up and went
to ſleep. The People who were in the Houſe ſuſpected nothing for ſome
time, till at laſt wondering at his long Reſt, they came into his
Apartment, and found him Dead.</p>

                  <hi>Apuleius</hi> thus gives the Relation. He was reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99270:143"/>to break up; but not without a Promiſe from the Poet, to
give them the reſt of the Play the day after. Accordingly the next day, a
vaſt Multitude met; great crouding there was for places, and great
expectation of the Entertainment. At laſt when every ones patience had been
pretty well tired; ſome of the fleeteſt in the Company were diſpatch'd to
enquire after <hi>Philemon,</hi> and to bring him along with them. The
Meſſengers taking their way to his Houſe; found him dead in his Bed:

               <p>It was not enough, what was before obſerv'd of
<hi>Theocritus,</hi> that he had engroſs'd the Credit and the Writings of the
other Paſtoral Poets; for, it ſeems he had robed one of them of his very
Name: Since we find ſome Criticks maintaining that <hi>Moſchus</hi> and
<hi>Theocritus</hi> are the ſame Perſon. But they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
confuted by the remark already made, that in <hi>Moſchus</hi>'s Elegy on
<hi>Bion,</hi> he brings in <hi>Theocritus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the ſame
Misfortune in another Country. <hi>Suidas</hi> will have <hi>Moſchus</hi> to
have been a Profeſſor of Grammar at <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> But it's certain
that when he made that Elegy, his reſidence was among the <hi>Italians,</hi>
(tho' perhaps in thoſe parts which lay over againſt <hi>Sicily</hi>) where
he ſeems to have been Scholar to <hi>Bion;</hi> and probably his
Succeſſor in Governing the Poetick School. Moſt of this may be fairly
deduced from his own Words.

               <p>The few Remains of theſe two Poets are reckon'd among the
ſweeteſt Pieces of the Ancient Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. It is obſervable that
<hi>Moſchus,</hi> tho Scholar to the other yet is always honour'd with the
Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by the Criticks, who have Publiſh'd or Iluſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Works.
The occaſion of this favour was probably their finding a little nearer
reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to <hi>Theocritus</hi> in <hi>His</hi> Conduct and Style; than
they could obſerve in <hi>Bion</hi>'s. Not but that he and <hi>Bion</hi>
both, ſeem in a great meaſure to have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected that blunt Ruſticity and
Plainneſs, which was ſo admir'd an Art of their Great Rival. For they aim
always at ſomething more polite and gentile, tho' equally natural, in their
Compoſitions. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the greateſt part of their Subjects, not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the direct talk and Converſation of Shepherds, may be excus'd, if they are
adorn'd with more Grace and Elegancy, as long as the Original Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity is
not deſtroy'd. As the Paſtoral Muſe is not to be ſet on a Throne like a
Princeſs, ſo ſhe looks altogether as ungainly if ſhe always lies along,
picking the Graſs, or kiſſing the Green Turf. The main Beauty is what
<hi>Boileau</hi> calls <hi>deſcendre ſans baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, to ſtoop
without creeping;</hi> and this perhaps may ſhine as fair in them, as in
<hi>Theocritus.</hi> However,<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99270:146"/>they will pretend to have
ſome advantage of him, in the Happineſs of Wit, and of Expreſſion; in
the moving ſoftneſs of Paſſion; in the nice choice and order of Words,
and the ſweet Harmony of Verſe which flows from thoſe Graces. And, in
ſhort, if their Works are not admitted among ſome for ſo true
Paſtorals, they certainly paſs among moſt Men for better Poems.</p>
